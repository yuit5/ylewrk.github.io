00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.089
Now, in this section we have effectively built something similar

00:00:03.089 --> 00:00:06.269
to smart pointers using the RAII paradigm.

00:00:06.269 --> 00:00:09.089
We have taken away the responsibility of pairing new and

00:00:09.089 --> 00:00:13.035
delete from the programmer and hidden it inside our class.

00:00:13.035 --> 00:00:15.780
This is essentially what the real smart pointers in

00:00:15.779 --> 00:00:19.125
C++11 do among many other things, of course.

00:00:19.125 --> 00:00:22.390
Let's take a look at these in the next section.
