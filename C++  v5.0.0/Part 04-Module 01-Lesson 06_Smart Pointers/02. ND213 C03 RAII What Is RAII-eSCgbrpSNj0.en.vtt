00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:12.044
It's the idea that when you come into a scope,

00:00:12.044 --> 00:00:13.994
into a function or whatever,

00:00:13.994 --> 00:00:18.000
you grab the resources you need and you initialize

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.815
a local object that then holds those resources,

00:00:22.815 --> 00:00:27.539
represent the abstraction that those resources are used for,

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:35.115
and at at the end in the scope they get released automatically.

00:00:35.115 --> 00:00:42.079
The operations that creates objects are called constructors,

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:43.984
they construct objects, obvious;

00:00:43.984 --> 00:00:45.859
and I couldn't resist the pattern.

00:00:45.859 --> 00:00:48.109
So the ones that reverses that operation,

00:00:48.109 --> 00:00:49.414
that cleans up the mess,

00:00:49.414 --> 00:00:51.924
if necessary, are called distractors.

00:00:51.924 --> 00:00:54.884
So somewhere in the scope,

00:00:54.884 --> 00:00:56.759
often towards the top,

00:00:56.759 --> 00:00:58.079
you construct the object,

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.339
you initialize the object,

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.200
and at the end, you clean it up and it's called resource

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:08.100
acquisition is initialization shortened to RAII.

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:12.349
Well, I was very busy when I thought of that

00:01:12.349 --> 00:01:17.689
and it's not a good name for it and I should not be in marketing.
