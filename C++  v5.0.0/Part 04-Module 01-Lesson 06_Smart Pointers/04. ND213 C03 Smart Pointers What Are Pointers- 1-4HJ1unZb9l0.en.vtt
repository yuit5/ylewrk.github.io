00:00:04.669 --> 00:00:09.794
Well, if you really, really need a pointer out of the user-space.

00:00:09.794 --> 00:00:12.179
So even in your implementation you may have

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.789
a raw pointer but then you have to do everything basic.

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:22.214
The most basic smart pointer is known as unique pointer,

00:00:22.214 --> 00:00:26.204
it's a pointer that I own the object at the other end.

00:00:26.204 --> 00:00:32.295
So if I have it when this pointer goes out of scope,

00:00:32.295 --> 00:00:33.899
the object gets deleted.

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.519
So it's very easy I hold on to it with that unique pointer,

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.890
if I give it to you now you have it.

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.850
If you go out of scope it will be deleted immediately.

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.189
If it was raw pointers we would have to

00:00:46.189 --> 00:00:48.890
have an agreement about who's going to do the delete.

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:51.170
But if I give you a unique pointer,

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.125
I transfer ownership implicitly.

00:00:54.125 --> 00:01:02.244
The most popular and probably too popular smart pointer in C++ is the share pointer.

00:01:02.244 --> 00:01:04.640
It's the one were you don't know who owns it.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.189
So I can give you my share pointer,

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:09.004
I give you one, give him one,

00:01:09.004 --> 00:01:14.750
and the last one to stop using it will implicitly delete the object.

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:16.849
So it's a form of garbage collection,

00:01:16.849 --> 00:01:22.879
it's much as what is done in several other languages Swift,

00:01:22.879 --> 00:01:28.824
Python and such, except that it works for anything.

00:01:28.825 --> 00:01:33.680
This objects can hold locks and file handles and things like that,

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.230
it's not just memory, it's resource management.

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:43.859
But currently they got very popular after C++ 11,

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:48.709
when people still used a lot of pointers and got into trouble with

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:54.349
the resource management and share pointers get them out or most of them.

00:01:54.349 --> 00:01:58.199
But it's even better to use local objects mostly.
