00:00:04.639 --> 00:00:09.779
There's something that came in at the first week of the design of C++,

00:00:09.779 --> 00:00:12.480
the idea that you have an operation that

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.804
initializes and operation that cleans up when you're finished.

00:00:17.804 --> 00:00:20.550
That's how you're going to have things in the scope.

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.890
Because one is a local variable,

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.580
a constructor will start up when you first come to it.

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:29.639
When you're finished at the end of the scope,

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.079
the destructor will be coordinated to clean up all of this.

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:40.034
There are people who says that's the real secret to C++.

00:00:40.034 --> 00:00:45.274
Also competition, people trying to find what are your favorite C++ feature,

00:00:45.274 --> 00:00:48.829
and everybody agreed with a guy called Roger Orr,

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:51.179
the end curly brace,

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.710
the final closing brace because that's where all the magic happens,

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.384
that's for all of the destructors fire and clean up the messes.

00:01:01.384 --> 00:01:03.530
That means you can actually have these message.

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.480
You can grab lots of resources,

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:06.859
you can take locks,

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:08.599
you can open files,

00:01:08.599 --> 00:01:11.339
and all they cleaned up at the end.
