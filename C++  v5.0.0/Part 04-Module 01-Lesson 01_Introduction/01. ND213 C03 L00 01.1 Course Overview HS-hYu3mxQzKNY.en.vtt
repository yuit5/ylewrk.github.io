Hi and welcome to this course on memory management in C plus plus.

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:06.900
Now, before we dive into all the material that is waiting for you here,

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:08.805
let me introduce myself briefly.

00:00:08.805 --> 00:00:13.155
My name is Andreas Haya and I'm a professor of engineering at a German university.

00:00:13.155 --> 00:00:17.340
Also I do hold a PhD in computer science from Heidelberg University,

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.890
which is one of the oldest universities we have in

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.920
Germany and one of the most renowned also internationally.

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.460
I've been programming ever since I was 14,

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:27.725
starting with Pascal and then C plus plus,

00:00:27.725 --> 00:00:29.800
something like 25 years ago.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.429
During my time in the automotive industry I've created a number of interesting projects,

00:00:34.429 --> 00:00:37.970
such as an autonomous braking system based on computer vision with Bush,

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.190
and more recently an autonomous parking

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.585
system,during my time as a project manager with phosphor.

00:00:43.585 --> 00:00:45.475
On both of these projects,

00:00:45.475 --> 00:00:47.870
C Plus Plus was the best choice we could

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.740
make to create these ambitious feats of engineering,

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:52.490
and maybe also of interest to you,

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:56.360
I have created a few other courses for Udacity such as the camera course in

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:02.090
the sensor fusion outdegree and also here the concurrency course in this degree.

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.290
So we will meet quite a few times over the next weeks and months.

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:09.440
Now, let's dive into memory management in C plus plus, which to me,

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.960
is one of the most interesting topics there is because

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.815
it really lets you get to the heart of the language.

00:01:14.815 --> 00:01:16.460
After completing this course,

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.565
you will have a much deeper understanding of C plus plus.

00:01:19.565 --> 00:01:21.305
That is something I can promise to you.

00:01:21.305 --> 00:01:24.540
So let's have a look at the course content now.
