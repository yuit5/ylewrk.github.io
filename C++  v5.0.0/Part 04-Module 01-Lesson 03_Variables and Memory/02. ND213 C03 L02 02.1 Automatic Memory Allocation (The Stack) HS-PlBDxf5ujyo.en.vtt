00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:02.819
Now, the stack is one of four areas in

00:00:02.819 --> 00:00:06.619
the process memory model which you as a programmer can use to hold data structures.

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:10.890
It is faster than the heap because the operating system has much less managing overhead,

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:14.010
and the only thing it does is to move a pointer to the top of the stack,

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.679
up and down depending on the variables and

00:00:16.679 --> 00:00:20.160
functions in the local scope and the function calls that happened within.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.230
From our perspective as a programmer,

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.929
stack memory is easy to use and we do not have to

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:28.199
concern ourselves at all with memory deallocation.

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.869
However, there are some downsides also as

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:33.630
always to stack memory as we will see in this section.

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.770
So let's take a look.
