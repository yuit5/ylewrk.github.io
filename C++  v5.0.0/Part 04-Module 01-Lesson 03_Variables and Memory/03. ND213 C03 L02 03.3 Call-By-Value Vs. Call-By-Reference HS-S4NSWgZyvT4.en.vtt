00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.480
We have seen quite a few examples in this section.

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:04.560
You should be aware of the differences between

00:00:04.559 --> 00:00:09.524
call-by-value and call-by-reference with regard to memory usage and data ownership.

00:00:09.525 --> 00:00:12.210
Also you have seen that it makes a difference whether you

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.810
harness 32-bit or 64-bit operating system,

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:18.855
and even though the data structures from the examples have been small,

00:00:18.855 --> 00:00:21.615
imagine a program where you have to create many, many,

00:00:21.614 --> 00:00:25.139
many of such structures or maybe even larger structures which could

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.070
eventually lead to stack overflow and thus a program crash.

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.510
In the upcoming chapters,

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.469
call-by-value and call-by-reference will play an important role in many situations.

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.929
So let's move on to the next lesson which will introduce

00:00:36.929 --> 00:00:41.009
dynamic memory management on the heap. See you there.
