00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.004
Welcome to the lesson on writing multi-file programs in C++.

00:00:04.004 --> 00:00:05.535
So far in this course,

00:00:05.535 --> 00:00:08.175
you've written all of your code in a single file.

00:00:08.175 --> 00:00:12.179
This works well for small programs or while you're prototyping an idea.

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:13.754
But as your code-base grows,

00:00:13.755 --> 00:00:16.830
you'll want the ability to organize your code into multiple files,

00:00:16.829 --> 00:00:19.389
just as you might have done in other languages you've worked with.

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:22.100
In this lesson you'll learn how to do exactly that.

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:25.040
We'll start out with header files and you'll

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:28.464
use header files to break a single file into multiple files.

00:00:28.464 --> 00:00:31.370
Then you'll learn a little bit about build systems which

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:34.550
will allow you to efficiently build large programs,

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:38.434
and a particular build system we'll cover is CMake and Make.

00:00:38.435 --> 00:00:43.285
Then you'll learn some tools for writing larger programs including references,

00:00:43.284 --> 00:00:50.464
pointers, maps, classes and a little bit of object-oriented programming in C++.

00:00:50.465 --> 00:00:52.010
You will learn a lot more about

00:00:52.009 --> 00:00:55.009
object-oriented programming in a later course in this nano degree.

00:00:55.009 --> 00:00:56.299
But after this lesson,

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:58.789
you'll be ready to tackle the route planning project and you'll

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:02.310
be prepared to write your own multi-file programs.
