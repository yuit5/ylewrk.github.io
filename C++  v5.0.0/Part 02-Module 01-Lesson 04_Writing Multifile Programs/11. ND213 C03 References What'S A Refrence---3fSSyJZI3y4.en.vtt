00:00:05.389 --> 00:00:10.574
A lot of the time in code you have to point at some stuff that's over there.

00:00:10.574 --> 00:00:14.669
One of the reasons is that you don't want to move the stuff around all the time,

00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:19.800
so you sent what is either called a pointer or reference or what they're.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.190
In C++, a pointer and a reference are roughly the

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:26.790
same except that it's easier to use a reference,

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.605
you don't have to say,

00:00:28.605 --> 00:00:29.835
"Go in there and get it",

00:00:29.835 --> 00:00:31.410
you just use it.

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.579
It's like a reference in many other languages like Java or such,

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:43.460
and furthermore a reference cannot be made to refer to a different object.

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:48.500
If I want to give you a reference to an object and if you're on a reference,

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.189
and you can now use my object but you can't make your reference point

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:56.420
to other objects of mine which you could with a pointer,

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.570
which comes from C and well in hardware,

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.920
if you have an address in some place you can give its pointer you don't know the address.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.420
So that is good for low-level hardware and it's bad for the higher levels.

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:14.310
Reference only refers to one thing and that's it.,
