00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:09.539
Dennis Ritchie had a brilliant idea which was

00:00:09.539 --> 00:00:15.059
the basic machine model of C. It says that the memory,

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:18.283
all the data sequences of objects,

00:00:18.283 --> 00:00:24.000
and you can refer to them by pointers which are machine addresses with a type.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.719
So fundamentally, a pointer is a machine address and so is,

00:00:28.719 --> 00:00:30.285
by the way, a reference.

00:00:30.285 --> 00:00:32.460
In memory, they look the same.

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:38.024
A pointer, you then associate the type with it at compile time,

00:00:38.024 --> 00:00:39.990
so that you know that you're pointing

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:46.925
to an integer or pointing to a string or something like that.

00:00:46.924 --> 00:00:50.299
The memory model of C, which C++ adopted,

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:54.909
is that if you want the integer next to the integers you are pointing to,

00:00:54.909 --> 00:01:00.149
you can either say plus one or minus one and navigate through the memory.

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.920
That's what a pointer is.

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:11.099
It's a machine address with a type associated with it at compile time.
