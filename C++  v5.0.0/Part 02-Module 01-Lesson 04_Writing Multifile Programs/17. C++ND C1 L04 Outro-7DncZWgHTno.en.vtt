00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
Well done. You are now able to break a single file program into

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.030
multiple files and you've learned some of the tools

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:08.714
that will allow you to create larger programs in the future.

00:00:08.714 --> 00:00:11.699
Let's do a quick review of what you've learned in this lesson.

00:00:11.699 --> 00:00:14.339
We started out this lesson with header files,

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:17.894
where you used headers to break a single file into multiple files.

00:00:17.894 --> 00:00:20.339
Then you learned a little bit about build systems,

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:23.655
and in particular you learned about CMake and Make.

00:00:23.655 --> 00:00:28.395
Finally, you learned some tools for writing larger programs including references,

00:00:28.394 --> 00:00:35.210
pointers, maps, classes, and a little bit about object oriented programming in C++.

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.285
Headers, CMake, pointers, and references,

00:00:38.284 --> 00:00:40.519
and object-oriented programming are topics you will

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.040
see over and over again throughout this Nanodegree.

00:00:43.039 --> 00:00:46.894
So you'll get a lot more practice with each of them as you continue beyond this course.

00:00:46.895 --> 00:00:50.975
However, you are now well-prepared to start the final project for the course.

00:00:50.975 --> 00:00:53.939
Have a look at the next lesson to get started.
