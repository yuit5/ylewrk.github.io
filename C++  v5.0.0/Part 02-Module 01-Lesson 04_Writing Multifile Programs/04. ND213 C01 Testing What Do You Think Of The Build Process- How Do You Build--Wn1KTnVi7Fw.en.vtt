00:00:04.459 --> 00:00:10.150
Different organizations have big and elaborate build processes

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:15.544
to get their software produced consistently, coherently.

00:00:15.544 --> 00:00:18.420
You can repeat the process,

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.090
and things like that.

00:00:21.089 --> 00:00:24.609
They vary a bit from organization to organization.

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:27.539
It's not really my home territory.

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.780
If you use an IDE, it would do simple things simply.

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.080
When you are starting with C++,

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:38.894
that's not probably where you would start.

00:00:38.895 --> 00:00:45.185
Then you go to make in CMake and then you may use more specific tool build systems,

00:00:45.185 --> 00:00:51.490
but really they are somewhat different and you have to learn a few.
