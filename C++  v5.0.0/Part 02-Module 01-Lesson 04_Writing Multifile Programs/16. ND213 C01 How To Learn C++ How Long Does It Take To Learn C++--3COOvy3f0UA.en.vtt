00:00:02.649 --> 00:00:06.634
How long does it take to learn C++?

00:00:06.634 --> 00:00:11.980
Depends what you want to do and what you already know.

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:19.304
If you are already a programmer in quite a few languages,

00:00:19.304 --> 00:00:24.600
my recommendation is to read the two of C++ second edition.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.054
You can do it in a weekend. Now we have the fundamentals and you have to

00:00:29.054 --> 00:00:33.799
do some experimentation and probably dig deeper into the areas you are interested in.

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:35.209
If you want to do anything,

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.160
you have to pick up some libraries and learn them.

00:00:38.159 --> 00:00:42.064
But we're talking days or weeks.

00:00:42.064 --> 00:00:43.899
But that assumes you're programmer.

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:47.039
If I have to explain to you what a linked-list is or what a vector is,

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.625
or what a hash table is,

00:00:48.625 --> 00:00:50.490
then it takes much longer.

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:55.795
So if you start from the beginning to reach the professional level,

00:00:55.795 --> 00:00:58.910
we're talking months and years.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.810
One question I sometime ask is how long does it take to play a violin?

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:06.865
To learn to play a violin?

00:01:06.864 --> 00:01:10.394
Well, if nobody's listening, it's easy.

00:01:10.394 --> 00:01:14.064
If only our mother has to appreciate it maybe it'll

00:01:14.064 --> 00:01:18.200
do fine but otherwise it'll take years.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.579
Now, if you're already a violinist and you want to play a viola,

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:25.049
you can probably do it in a couple of weeks.

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.909
Depends what you are,

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:29.390
what your background is,

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:34.500
what you're already knows and then how good do you want to be at it.

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.724
If you're thinking about the Lincoln Center,

00:01:37.724 --> 00:01:41.504
you better spent years and the equivalent for

00:01:41.504 --> 00:01:45.920
a programming language if you want to be the ace program building

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:54.689
the next generation infrastructure or the next absolutely great application,

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.914
you better spend some years learning not just the programming language

00:01:58.915 --> 00:02:03.850
but your basic computer science and your application areas.
