00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Let's talk about motion planning.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
The fundamental problem in motion planning is that a robot might live in a world like this,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and it might want to find its way to a goal like this

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and has to device a plan to get there.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
This same problem occurs for a self driving car

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000
that might live in a city near a highway on a network of streets.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:34.000
It has to find its way around and navigate to its target location.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
If we zoom in and look at this intersection,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
and this is my best rendering of a street-light environment.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
We have also planning problems here.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Picture a car coming from here that wishes to go over here.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
To take a left turn on this intersection over here,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
this car would have to turn right first,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
engage in a lane shift and then take the left turn to the goal location.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Now, a lane shift over here is a risky proposition.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
If there's a bit truck parked over here,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
the space might be insufficient to carry out the lane shift.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:15.000
An alternative plan might be to go straight over here, take the detour around the block,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
and then go straight to the target location.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
The process of finding a path from a start location to a goal location

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
is called "planning."

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
For robots, it's often called "robot motion planning.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Today I'm going to talk about discrete methods for planning

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
in which the world chopped into small bins.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
In the next class we're going to talk about continuous motion using those plans.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
What's the planning problem? We're given a map of the world.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
We're given a starting location.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
We're given a goal location.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Usually, we're given some sort of a cost function.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000
The simplest way to think of cost is just the time it takes to drive a certain route.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
The goal is find the minimum cost path.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Before we program anything, let me see if I can ask you a couple of questions

00:02:04.000 --> 09:59:59.000
for minimum cost paths.
