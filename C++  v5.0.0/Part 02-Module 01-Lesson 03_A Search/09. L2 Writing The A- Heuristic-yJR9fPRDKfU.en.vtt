00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160
In the next exercise,

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:05.130
you'll write the A* heuristic function.

00:00:05.129 --> 00:00:08.429
This function provides a score for each node that

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.894
helps A* decide which node to explore next.

00:00:11.894 --> 00:00:15.224
In our implementation, the heuristic assigned to

00:00:15.224 --> 00:00:19.230
each node gets lower as the nodes get closer to the goal.

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.420
That's right. If you choose the next node with the lowest overall cost,

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:28.330
the heuristic function ensures that you will be moving towards the goal with this choice.
