00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Let me look at a different maze, and this is not a car example anymore,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
but it's close to what we're going to program.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Suppose we start over here, and our goal is to go into this corner over here.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
There are multiple blocked cells along the way.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:26.000
In this case, we have a robot that can go up, down, left, or right.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
How many steps does it take for the robot that starts over here

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
to reach the goal position?

00:00:31.000 --> 09:59:59.000
