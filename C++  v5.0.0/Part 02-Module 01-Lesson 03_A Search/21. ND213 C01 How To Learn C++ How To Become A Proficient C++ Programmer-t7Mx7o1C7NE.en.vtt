A proficient programmer will know the basic of his or her tools,

00:00:11.054 --> 00:00:13.304
and C++ is one of those.

00:00:13.304 --> 00:00:16.844
If you're on C++ you should know your basic libraries,

00:00:16.844 --> 00:00:18.689
you should know your standard library.

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.910
You should know the domain-specific library in the domain you're working at.

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:30.269
You should know the language at a reasonable good conceptual level.

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:37.640
You should not just go on the web and copy and paste some simple formulas in.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.424
That's not programming.

00:00:39.424 --> 00:00:42.274
That's not understanding what you are doing.

00:00:42.274 --> 00:00:48.210
So you actually have to go and read a book and take a course to become a good programmer.
