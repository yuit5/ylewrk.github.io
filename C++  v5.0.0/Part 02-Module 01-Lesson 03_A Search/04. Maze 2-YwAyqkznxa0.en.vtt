00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Let's look at the path planning problem as a search problem.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
If you took my AI online class, you know what this is all about,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
but I want to make sure that everybody can understand what I'm talking about.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Let's start with a little grid world of size 6 x 5

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:22.000
where our start location is in the top left corner, our goal in the bottom right corner.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
I block off a few cells so there is still a safe path to the goal.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
This could be a search through a city graph, through a parking lot,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
or through a maze of streets for a mobile robot.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Just for simplicity, in this example let's assume the robot is given 4 actions.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
It can go up, down, left, or right.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Also for simplicity, let's assume every action succeeds with absolute certainty.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
We don't model uncertainty in this example.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:00.000
The path planning or search problem is to find the shortest sequence of actions

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
that leads our robot from the start state to the goal state.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Just to check, tell me how many you think these are.

00:01:08.000 --> 09:59:59.000
How many action are required to go from start to goal?
