00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.485
Excellent work.

00:00:01.485 --> 00:00:04.469
You've built a maze solving algorithm that finds

00:00:04.469 --> 00:00:08.699
the path between the starting and ending points of your maze.

00:00:08.699 --> 00:00:12.989
You've done this starting from a blank slate in C++.

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.960
You've implemented nearly every piece of code from

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.870
start to end using the A-star algorithm.

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:22.410
Let's do a quick review of what you've seen in this lesson.

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.089
We started out with an introduction to vehicle motion planning.

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:30.884
Sebastian explained the A-star search algorithm,

00:00:30.885 --> 00:00:34.910
then you wrote your own version of the A-star search algorithm.

00:00:34.909 --> 00:00:40.509
You broke down different parts of the algorithm over a series of exercises.

00:00:40.509 --> 00:00:44.314
Then you learned about new C++ language features

00:00:44.314 --> 00:00:49.579
including passing variables to a function by reference instead of by value,

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:52.473
const in const expression,

00:00:52.473 --> 00:00:54.549
and arrays in C++.

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:58.669
You're now almost ready to start the course project where you'll

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.530
use what you've learned to find a path between any two points on a real map.

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.260
Before you're ready to do the project,

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.780
you'll need to learn a little bit about how to write

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.489
larger C++ programs using multiple files.

00:01:12.489 --> 00:01:14.109
In the next lesson,

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:18.305
you'll learn about header files and build tools to help with this.

00:01:18.305 --> 00:01:22.010
You'll also learn about pointers and references and

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:27.880
a tiny little bit about object oriented programming. Let's get started.
