Great work. You're almost done with A* Search.

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:05.565
For the last part of the search,

00:00:05.565 --> 00:00:08.625
you will be finding valid neighbors to add to the search vector.

00:00:08.625 --> 00:00:13.245
Valid in this case means that the cell is open and you haven't visited it before.

00:00:13.244 --> 00:00:15.524
That sounds good.

00:00:15.525 --> 00:00:18.179
I don't think we'd want to crash into any obstacles.

00:00:18.179 --> 00:00:20.250
I don't think so. Let's get started.
