00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The answer is 7.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
As you can see, the shortest path will lead along here.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Then it becomes ambiguous. We could either go right or up.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Let's say we randomly go up and hit the goal--

00:00:13.000 --> 09:59:59.000
so 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 steps to the goal.
