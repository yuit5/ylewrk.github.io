00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.504
To choose the next node in the A* search,

00:00:02.504 --> 00:00:05.654
you want to find the node with the lowest overall cost.

00:00:05.655 --> 00:00:08.054
This cost, also called the F value,

00:00:08.054 --> 00:00:10.154
is the sum of two other values;

00:00:10.154 --> 00:00:12.539
the H value and the G value.

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:18.765
The H value or heuristic gets smaller the closer node is to the goal.

00:00:18.765 --> 00:00:20.219
So incorporating this into

00:00:20.219 --> 00:00:23.835
your overall cost ensures you're searching in the right direction.

00:00:23.835 --> 00:00:28.469
The G value or distance cost increases with each step in the search.

00:00:28.469 --> 00:00:32.039
Incorporating this cost into the overall cost ensures that the search

00:00:32.039 --> 00:00:36.585
finds the most direct route possible instead of wandering around the grid.

00:00:36.585 --> 00:00:38.759
In the next exercise,

00:00:38.759 --> 00:00:41.929
you'll create a comparison function that will be used to

00:00:41.929 --> 00:00:45.500
sort nodes in order to choose the next one.
