00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.640
Now, this lesson on move semantics has been quite intense.

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:04.379
It's not an easy topic to deal with,

00:00:04.379 --> 00:00:07.589
but investing the effort to understand it is time well-spent.

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.544
Now move semantics is one of the major innovations brought by the C++ Standard,

00:00:11.544 --> 00:00:16.170
and it's an important tool for increasing performance by making cheap shallow copies,

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.965
instead of costly deep copies when passing objects around in your program.

00:00:19.964 --> 00:00:24.570
Also, this idea of dedicated ownership is a crucial concept both for

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.960
concurrent programming when dealing with protected resources as well

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.725
as for smart pointers which we will look at in the next lesson.

00:00:31.725 --> 00:00:33.969
See you there finally.
