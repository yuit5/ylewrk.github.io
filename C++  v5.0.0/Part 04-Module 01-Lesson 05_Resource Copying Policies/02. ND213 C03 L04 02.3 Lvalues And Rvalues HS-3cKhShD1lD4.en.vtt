00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.089
Now, this section has some very important concepts for you.

00:00:03.089 --> 00:00:05.400
You should now be very familiar with l-values and

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.595
also r-values and with l-value references.

00:00:08.595 --> 00:00:12.075
In fact, you have seen and used those before many times already.

00:00:12.074 --> 00:00:13.739
It will not be surprising though if

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.425
r-value references would still seem somewhat unfamiliar.

00:00:16.425 --> 00:00:19.859
Now, the question may well arise what this construct could be used for.

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.829
After all, we have already seen that some copy operations can be

00:00:22.829 --> 00:00:25.994
saved if we use r-value references instead of l-values.

00:00:25.995 --> 00:00:29.519
For example, to directly capture the result of an addition.

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.609
Now, in the next section, we will look at one of the main areas of

00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:35.759
application for r-value references which is move semantics.

00:00:35.759 --> 00:00:37.839
So let's get started.
