00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
In this section, you have learned about bits and bytes, about base-2, base-10,

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.570
and base-16 numbering systems,

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:11.760
and you have seen how information can be represented using a sequence of zeros and ones.

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:15.680
This knowledge gives you the basics for understanding the structure of computer memory,

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.165
and this is what we'll look at in the next section.

00:00:18.165 --> 00:00:20.500
So see you there shortly.
