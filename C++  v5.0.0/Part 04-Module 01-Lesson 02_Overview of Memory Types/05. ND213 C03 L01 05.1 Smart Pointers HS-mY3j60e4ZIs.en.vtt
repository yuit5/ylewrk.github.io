00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
In the last section, we have seen how the computer cache can speed up

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.779
programs by moving data from slow memory into fast memory,

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:08.804
and that will be needed by the CPU in the near future.

00:00:08.804 --> 00:00:10.994
That's the basic idea of a cache.

00:00:10.994 --> 00:00:14.939
In this section, we will take a look at the concept of virtual memory.

00:00:14.939 --> 00:00:17.189
It's safe to say that a virtual memory makes it

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.460
possible to run your program on a variety of computers,

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.070
all with different amounts of memory and disk space,

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.039
without the need to change the thing in your code,

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:31.199
and virtual memory assigns a contiguous and well ordered block of memory to each program,

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.329
and takes care that other programs do not

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.030
interfere with the virtual memory of your program.

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.770
Let's take a look at how this works,

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.080
and what it means to us as programmers.
