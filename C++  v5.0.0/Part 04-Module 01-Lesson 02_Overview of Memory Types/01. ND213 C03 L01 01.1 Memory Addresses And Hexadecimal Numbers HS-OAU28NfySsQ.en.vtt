00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.855
Now, before we go into the details of memory management in C++,

00:00:03.855 --> 00:00:07.009
I want you to understand the structure of computer memory.

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:09.570
You will most certainly know that information and computers

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.150
are stored as a sequence of zeros and ones,

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:13.620
which are also called bits.

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:18.089
Now, a bit by the way is the smallest piece of information we can have in computing.

00:00:18.089 --> 00:00:22.134
You will also know that eight bits are grouped into something called a byte.

00:00:22.135 --> 00:00:25.660
Now, bits and bytes are expressed in a base two number system,

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:29.094
which is an alternative to the base 10 we're also familiar.

00:00:29.094 --> 00:00:31.239
What some programmers do not know however,

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:33.949
is that in addition to the base two numbering system,

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:36.520
there is also a base 16 system,

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.345
which plays an important role in memory management.

00:00:39.344 --> 00:00:41.359
Now, the idea of this section is to give you

00:00:41.359 --> 00:00:44.539
an introduction into why base two is so useful,

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:47.719
how bits and bytes can be used to represent information,

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:50.045
and what a base 16 system does for us.

00:00:50.045 --> 00:00:53.070
So let's go and look at some numbers.
