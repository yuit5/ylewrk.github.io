00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.160
Now, virtual memory is a concept from which we really benefit as programmers.

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:06.150
We do not have to concern ourselves with

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.540
the specific hardware configuration of the computer we are working on.

00:00:09.539 --> 00:00:11.129
We can simply write a program,

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.290
compile it, and be done with it.

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:15.644
However, the virtual memory does not remove

00:00:15.644 --> 00:00:18.359
the necessity of cache and reprogramming altogether.

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.445
Also knowing about what's beneath

00:00:20.445 --> 00:00:23.339
the shiny surface of your current block of program memory is

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:25.559
beneficial in such cases where you want to

00:00:25.559 --> 00:00:28.769
squeeze some extra performance out of your programs.

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.800
Now a low-hanging fruit would be to relocate

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.750
the virtual swap file on your computer to

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.049
a faster location such as a high-speed solid state.

00:00:37.049 --> 00:00:39.199
One huge advantage of virtual memory is

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.859
the contiguous address space you get for each program.

00:00:41.859 --> 00:00:43.789
This makes it possible to divide

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:47.299
the addresses in this space into areas for dedicated usage.

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:48.589
You could for example say,

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.355
okay this is an area where only global variables live.

00:00:51.354 --> 00:00:53.239
Or you could fence a memory range in which

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.789
the programmer and which the program code is stored,

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:57.784
where the programmer has no direct access to.

00:00:57.784 --> 00:01:01.199
Such a thing exists and it is called Memory Model.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.250
Knowing about the structure and the properties of the different areas of

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.859
the C++ memory model is basically what

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:09.739
memory management and also this course is all about.

00:01:09.739 --> 00:01:12.289
You now know how memory is structured on a bit level,

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.094
you know about different memory types and the properties,

00:01:15.093 --> 00:01:18.309
and you've seen what virtual memory does for you.

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:19.359
In the next lesson,

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:21.599
we will dive deeper into the C++ memory model,

00:01:21.599 --> 00:01:25.155
and we will also talk about the concepts of heap and of stack,

00:01:25.155 --> 00:01:27.064
which you might already have heard about.

00:01:27.064 --> 00:01:29.750
But beware, it's going to be a really deep dive.

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.159
So see there shortly.
