00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419
In the last section, you have seen how binary and text numbers

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:06.419
can be used to store information such as text on a computer.

00:00:06.419 --> 00:00:09.629
Now in this section, we will use a debugger to glimpse directly into

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.860
computer memory to locate a string of characters and its binary form.

00:00:13.859 --> 00:00:16.050
The key idea here is to understand that there is

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:18.690
no magic behind storing information in memory.

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.420
Based on a coding scheme such as ASCII, for example,

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.298
data is available to us and we can directly see it in computer memory and if necessary,

00:00:26.298 --> 00:00:28.750
we can also change it and store it.

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:31.234
Before we start, I'd like to warn you a little bit.

00:00:31.234 --> 00:00:32.960
The GDP output is not pretty,

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.030
there is no need graphical user interface we will

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:37.325
use to look at a colorful display up on memory,

00:00:37.325 --> 00:00:40.580
but instead, we will see the raw numbers in the terminal,

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:42.409
both in binary and in hex form.

00:00:42.409 --> 00:00:44.519
So let's go for it.
