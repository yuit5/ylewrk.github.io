00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.089
Now, when I conducted such an experiment for the very first time,

00:00:03.089 --> 00:00:07.334
I was absolutely amazed by the window that opened up into the memory of my computer.

00:00:07.334 --> 00:00:09.929
Looking at the raw bits and bytes can really take

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.719
away a sense of complexity from the topic of memory management.

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.510
It can show us that at the very bottom of it,

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.579
there are only ones and zeros.

00:00:17.579 --> 00:00:19.199
If we know the coding scheme,

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:20.309
we can even understand them.

00:00:20.309 --> 00:00:23.114
Now that we have directly accessed memory cells,

00:00:23.114 --> 00:00:28.109
the question arises, where this exercise actually took place physically in the computer.

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:29.969
In order to answer this question,

00:00:29.969 --> 00:00:31.919
we need to take a close look at

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.875
the different forms of computer memory in the next section.

00:00:34.875 --> 00:00:37.270
So see you all there shortly.
