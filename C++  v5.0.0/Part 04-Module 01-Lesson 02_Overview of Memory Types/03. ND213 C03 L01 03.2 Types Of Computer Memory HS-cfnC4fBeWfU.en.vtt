Now as we have seen, computer memory is organized in a hierarchy.

00:00:03.299 --> 00:00:08.250
The idea is to ensure that the CPU is running smoothly without too many white cycles.

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.599
To make this work, data that is currently needed has to be high up in the hierarchy,

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.035
while data that is seldomly needed should reside at the lower end.

00:00:16.035 --> 00:00:20.310
A very important bridge between high-speed CPU on the one side and slower memory on

00:00:20.309 --> 00:00:24.629
the other side is the cache memory in the middle which consists of various levels.

00:00:24.629 --> 00:00:25.739
In the next chapter,

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:27.719
we will look into caches more deeply,

00:00:27.719 --> 00:00:32.085
especially from the perspective of memory management and cache friendly programming.

00:00:32.085 --> 00:00:35.530
So don't wait too long and see you there shortly.
