00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.879
Now, I'm quite sure you will have heard about memory-related to

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:06.154
expressions such as random access memory or read-only memory.

00:00:06.155 --> 00:00:10.710
Maybe you're already familiar with cache memory even level one and level two caches.

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.780
Maybe you have heard about level three caches.

00:00:12.779 --> 00:00:17.189
Then there are ultra-fast memory registers close to the CPU and

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.500
ultra-slow hard disks with high storage capacities in the area of one terabyte.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.690
So you see, there are lots of memory types.

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:29.010
It is the goal of this section to show you how they compare with regard to speed,

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.545
capacity, and, of course, price.

00:00:31.545 --> 00:00:33.760
So let's take a look.
