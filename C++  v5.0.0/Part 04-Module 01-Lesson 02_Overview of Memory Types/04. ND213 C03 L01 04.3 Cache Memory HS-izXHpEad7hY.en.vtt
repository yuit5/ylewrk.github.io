00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.450
This section we have seen that exploiting knowledge about the workings of

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:06.929
cache memory can really increase the speed of your programs.

00:00:06.929 --> 00:00:11.804
A slight change in the order of two loops can cause a major speedup and also vice versa.

00:00:11.804 --> 00:00:14.849
The bottom line here is you need to have a grasp of

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.419
the structure of computer memory to produce high-performance code.

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.115
There is just no way around this.

00:00:20.114 --> 00:00:24.554
Now that we know about the different memory types and also about caches where to go next.

00:00:24.554 --> 00:00:27.495
Well, directly into C plus plus.

00:00:27.495 --> 00:00:30.480
Let's take a look at one more thing before we do this.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.799
I imagine you had optimized the program to run super efficiently on one machine

00:00:34.799 --> 00:00:39.439
and then on another machine it runs much slower or worse it crushes altogether.

00:00:39.439 --> 00:00:42.049
It would be really nice to be totally independent of

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:46.009
the hardware configuration of the computer on which your programs run.

00:00:46.009 --> 00:00:48.619
Also writing a new program with

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:51.259
variations for different hardware configurations would be really

00:00:51.259 --> 00:00:56.449
tedious and the solution to both of these aspects is called virtual memory.

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:59.480
That's what we'll take a look at in the last section of this lesson,

00:00:59.479 --> 00:01:02.069
so see you there shortly.
