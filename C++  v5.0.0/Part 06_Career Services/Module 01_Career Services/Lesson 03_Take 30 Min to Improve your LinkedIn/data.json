Ensure you're connecting with others across your field using LinkedIn - they'll help you find your next job and grow professionally.\n\n# No Resubmission Required\nUnlike other Nanodegree projects, you submit to a Career Service once to get feedback and do not need to meet specifications to continue on in your program.

How do you compare job candidates? You'll probably pick the candidates that stand out the most to you - likely the people who communicate their motivation and dedication for the job.\n\n## Personal Stories\nA job candidate's personal story is always unique to them. Employers aren't just looking for someone with the skills, but for someone who can help drive the company's mission forward. That's why they need to know your work ethic and what drives you.\n\n\nPersonal stories are memorable. Connect with your potential boss or colleague by telling your personal story. You want employers to know how you solve problems, overcome challenges, and achieve results. You want employers to know what excites you, what motivates you, what drives you forward.\n\n**All of this can be achieved through effective storytelling and building a personal brand.**\n\nIn this next video, meet **Chris Saden, a software engineer at Udacity,** who will share with us how he redefined his personal brand during a career change from admissions counselor to full stack engineer.",

Use this section to investigate, revise, and improve the highlighted sections.\n\nIf you don't have a LinkedIn profile - you will soon! Open up [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/) in another browser tab and create an account. You can expect to spend about 10 minutes going through LinkedIn's \"Welcome\" flow.\n\n## Keywords and SEO\n\nAs there are millions of LinkedIn users, you may be wondering how you stand out or are surfaced to recruiters. Below, we dive into the sections of your profile which are essential to SEO (search engine optimization - or optimizing your profile for searches on LinkedIn). \n\nOn your LinkedIn profile, more-so than on a resume or other application materials, it is helpful to use keywords specific to the job you are targeting. This is especially true of the words you include in your headline, summary, and current job title. Think of the words that a recruiter might type to search for candidates of your target job and check to ensure they're listed in your profile. \n\nFor example, if you were looking for a job developing mobile augmented reality apps, you might want to include words like  `engineer`, `iOS`, `Android`, `Unity`, or `3D`.\n\n> *Pro Tip*: To find keywords to add, read job descriptions of positions you are targeting. \n\nFor example, when you search \"Udacity Software Engineer\" on LinkedIn, you may find similar results to the image below. What do you notice about the search results?",

Ensuring your resume and LinkedIn are consistent will help to build your personal brand. \n\nIn our [free course on resume writing](https://www.udacity.com/course/refresh-your-resume--ud243), we provide detailed guidance on how to describe your work experiences in a way that showcases success. Here are some guidelines to keep in mind for both resumes and LinkedIn profiles: \n\n#### Be concise.\n- Include only relevant experience. \n- Keep each description to 3 bullet points or less.\n- At least 1 of these bullet points should demonstrate an individual contribution. \n- At least 1 of these bullet points should communicate a project result (success metrics, findings).\n\n#### Always convey [Action, Numbers, Success](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud243/lessons/db219674-a784-45f9-9829-d16a7a252bd0/concepts/3a826d6e-4610-4590-a896-20d2a2427f3e). \n \n- Action - Use active verbs to describe what you did. \n- Numbers - Quantify your accomplishments.\n- Success - Define each experience in terms of what you learned or achieved.\n\n#### Order matters.\nMake sure that your most relevant and most recent experience appears at the top of your profile.\n## Accomplishments\nYou can adapt the \"Accomplishments\" section of your LinkedIn profile to a wide variety of work experiences and achievements. For example, the \"Accomplishments\" section for \"Projects\" is an excellent place to **showcase your Udacity projects!** You can also list  the Udacity courses you have taken in the \"Accomplishments\" section for \"Courses.\"\n\nWhen describing your projects be sure to include the specific technical skills you learned relevant to your target field. Think about the parts of your Udacity projects that you are most proud of and frame them as successes in your project description. Here are a couple good examples from Udacity alums:\n\n[Kristin, Virtual Reality Developer Nanodegree Program Alum](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kristindragos/) - \nNotice how Kristin uses the project section to showcase the technologies she has worked with (i.e. Unity, Oculus Rift). She also provides links to visuals for each project, so that it's easy for recruiters and connections to dive deeper into a project that piques their curiosity.  \n\n[Michael, Self Driving Car Nanodegree Program Alum](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-virgo/) - \nNotice how Michael uses the \"Projects\" section to include more details about his experience with autonomous vehicles, and highlights his use of particular models like convolutional neural networks. \n",

In general, 500+ connections are needed to fully optimize your profile.\n\nThis may seem like a lot, but once you get rolling, you'll get to that number fast. After you actively start engaging on LinkedIn, by joining groups and going to networking events, your number of connections will climb. You are more likely to show up in search results on LinkedIn if you have more connections, which means you'll be more visible to recruiters.\n\nHere are some examples of the types of connections you could add:\n- current and former colleagues\n- people you attended school with (high school, university, graduate school, Udacity)\n- your favorite teachers and professors\n- people you meet at professional events, like conferences and meetups\n- volunteering companions\n- friends and relatives\n- roommates and neighbors\n\nNeed some incentive to get started? No time like the present. Finish the tasks below and check them off as you go!",

What's next? \nCreating a killer profile is a key first step toward building a strong LinkedIn presence, but there is a lot more you can do to nurture your connections and make your profile easy to find. Here are some of the avenues LinkedIn provides to engage with your professional community.\n\n### Follow\nFollow the influential companies in your target field to stay informed about new discoveries, trends, and current events in your professional sphere. Identify companies where you can imagine working, and follow those too; you'll see job posts sooner and you'll be more likely to show up in their recruiters' searches. \n\n### Post, Like, and Comment\nAuthoring original posts is a fantastic way to boost your visibility, but if you are a little shy about posting at first, don't worry. Plenty of people get meaningful value out of LinkedIn without authoring posts. You can also engage by liking and commenting; these small actions can go a long way toward boosting your visibility. \n\n### Endorse and Recommend\nThere are so many good reasons to endorse and recommend on LinkedIn. **Effective team players recognize the contributions of others.** By endorsing and recommending current and former colleagues you can show future coworkers that you are capable of acknowledging your teammates. This acknowledgement will also deepen your relationship with the colleagues and collaborators you endorse, not to mention it will increase the likelihood of someone acknowledging you in return. \n\nHere's a profile from [Mike, a former Udacity employee](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelwales/). Take a look at his \"Recommendations\" section. Notice that he has received and given multiple recommendations. Not only does this give us a window into working with Mike, but it shows that he's a colorful and clear communicator.\n",
