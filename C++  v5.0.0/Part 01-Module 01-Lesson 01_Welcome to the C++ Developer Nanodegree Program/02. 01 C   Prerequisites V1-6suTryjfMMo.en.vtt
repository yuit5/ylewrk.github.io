00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.895
The prerequisites for this Nanodegree program,

00:00:02.895 --> 00:00:07.650
are that you should be an intermediate level software programmer in any language.

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:11.745
As long as you know concepts like variables, conditionals,

00:00:11.744 --> 00:00:16.214
loops, and functions, you're ready to learn C++.

00:00:16.214 --> 00:00:21.120
We also expect that you know how to execute programs ideally from the terminal,

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.984
and that you're familiar with software debugging.

00:00:23.984 --> 00:00:27.079
It will be helpful if you're familiar with concepts

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:29.734
like classes in object-oriented programming,

00:00:29.734 --> 00:00:31.789
but that's not required.

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:35.210
If you feel like you need to learn a little bit more about

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.914
software programming before proceeding on with this Nanodegree,

00:00:38.914 --> 00:00:43.820
then I suggest either Udacity's intro to programming Nanodegree program,

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.344
or our intro to self-driving cars Nanodegree program.

00:00:47.344 --> 00:00:50.269
Our intro to programming Nanodegree program

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.165
will teach you the basics of software engineering,

00:00:53.164 --> 00:00:56.284
and our intro to self-driving cars Nanodegree program

00:00:56.284 --> 00:00:59.149
will teach you the basics of software engineering,

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:06.429
C++ specifically, along with topics like machine learning, physics, and mathematics.
