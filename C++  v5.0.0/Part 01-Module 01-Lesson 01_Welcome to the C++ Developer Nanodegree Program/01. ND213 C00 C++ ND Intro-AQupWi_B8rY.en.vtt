00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.379
Welcome to the Udacity C++ nanodegree program.

00:00:04.379 --> 00:00:07.574
C++ is such an exciting and important language

00:00:07.575 --> 00:00:10.440
for everything from self-driving cars to robotics,

00:00:10.439 --> 00:00:11.609
to the internet of things,

00:00:11.609 --> 00:00:14.730
and we are so excited to share this language with you.

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.545
Throughout this nanodegree program,

00:00:16.545 --> 00:00:20.535
you'll learn about C++ from expert instructors who will take you from

00:00:20.535 --> 00:00:23.490
the foundations of the C++ programming language

00:00:23.489 --> 00:00:26.654
all the way through to advanced in expert topics.

00:00:26.655 --> 00:00:28.800
One of the most exciting things about

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.350
this program is that you'll hear from Bjarne Stroustrup,

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:33.075
the creator of C++,

00:00:33.075 --> 00:00:36.750
who will tell you why different features of the language were designed the way they

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.399
are and how to best use them to create the most effective and efficient programs.

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.259
At Udacity, we believe in a learn-by-doing approach,

00:00:45.259 --> 00:00:48.320
which means that in order to become a C++ engineer,

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.320
you're going to need to write a lot of C++ code,

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.090
and we're going to help you do that.

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.100
By the end of this program,

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.950
you'll have a job ready project portfolio full of

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:02.960
all the different C++ applications that you've built as part of this nanodegree program.

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.070
Are you ready to learn C++? Let's get started.
