00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
This program is organized into four courses;

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:10.259
foundations, object-oriented programming, memory management and concurrency.

00:00:10.259 --> 00:00:12.734
In the foundations course,

00:00:12.734 --> 00:00:18.794
you'll learn about C plus plus syntax and how to compile and run C plus plus programs.

00:00:18.795 --> 00:00:22.429
You'll also learn about the input and output features of the language,

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:25.850
as well as how to declare and initialize variables,

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:29.600
structure your code using conditionals and loops,

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.405
and organize your code using functions.

00:00:32.405 --> 00:00:35.615
In the object oriented-programming course,

00:00:35.615 --> 00:00:39.359
you'll learn how to further organize your code into classes,

00:00:39.359 --> 00:00:44.090
and you'll learn how to expose interfaces to those classes to other users.

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.630
You'll also learn how to declare certain interfaces to be

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:51.590
public and certain to be private using access modifiers.

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:53.840
You'll cover the core concepts of

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.800
object-oriented programming generally including encapsulation,

00:00:57.799 --> 00:01:00.994
abstraction, inheritance and polymorphism,

00:01:00.994 --> 00:01:02.750
and you'll learn how to implement

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.959
those features using the C plus plus programming language.

00:01:05.959 --> 00:01:10.069
You'll close this course by learning about generic programming and how to

00:01:10.069 --> 00:01:14.679
use C plus plus templates to make your code more generic.

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.690
In the next course,

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:18.500
you'll learn about memory management.

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.625
Memory is incredibly important to the C plus plus programming language.

00:01:22.625 --> 00:01:26.704
You'll learn how to pass around both references and pointers,

00:01:26.704 --> 00:01:29.299
and you'll learn about the differences between memory on

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:32.284
the stack and memory allocated from the heap.

00:01:32.284 --> 00:01:37.789
You'll also learn how to take advantage of scope and use the resource acquisition

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:43.405
is initialization paradigm in order to keep track of memory that's used by your program.

00:01:43.405 --> 00:01:46.640
You'll close this course by learning about smart pointers,

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.879
which are the best way to keep track of pointers and

00:01:49.879 --> 00:01:53.814
dynamically allocated memory in modern C plus plus.

00:01:53.814 --> 00:01:56.474
The final course is concurrency.

00:01:56.474 --> 00:02:02.194
In this course, you'll learn how to organize your code using both processes and threads,

00:02:02.194 --> 00:02:06.199
and you'll learn how to synchronize and communicate between threads.

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.699
In particular, you'll learn about features of the C plus plus programming language that

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:15.849
support concurrent multi-threaded programming including promises and futures,

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:18.060
and mutexes, and locks.

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.995
By the time you're done with all four of these courses,

00:02:20.995 --> 00:02:25.490
you will be a terrific C plus plus developer.
