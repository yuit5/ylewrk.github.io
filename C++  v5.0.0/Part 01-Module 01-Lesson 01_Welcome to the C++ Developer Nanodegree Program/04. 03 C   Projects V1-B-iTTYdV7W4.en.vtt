00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.695
This nanodegree program requires you to complete five different projects.

00:00:04.695 --> 00:00:07.890
The first project is the route planner project,,

00:00:07.889 --> 00:00:12.254
in which you'll build a route planner to find a route between

00:00:12.255 --> 00:00:17.325
any two points in a real city using data from the OpenStreetMap Project.

00:00:17.324 --> 00:00:20.919
The second project is the system monitor project,

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:26.310
in which you'll implement your own version of the top program that identifies

00:00:26.309 --> 00:00:29.189
variables relevant to your system and prints out

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:32.895
information about all the different processes running on your computer.

00:00:32.895 --> 00:00:36.630
The third project is the garbage collector project,

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.530
in which you'll build your own version of smart pointers,

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.700
a way to keep track of dynamically allocated memory and prevent memory leaks.

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:49.215
The fourth project is a traffic simulation.

00:00:49.215 --> 00:00:50.960
In this project, you'll use

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.880
concurrent multi-threaded programming to organize traffic flow through a city.

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.745
Each vehicle will run on its own thread,

00:00:58.744 --> 00:01:00.890
and you'll use thread synchronization and

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.189
communication to help the vehicles navigate intersections,

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:07.129
and help traffic flow smoothly through the city.

00:01:07.129 --> 00:01:11.899
The final project of this nanodegree program is the Capstone project.

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.460
In this project, you'll build your own C++ application using

00:01:16.459 --> 00:01:18.619
many of the different skills and techniques that

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.870
you've learned as part of this nanodegree program.
