00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:09.914
You want to map to the user's concepts.

00:00:09.914 --> 00:00:14.160
And listening to them and have them explain their problems and

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.259
solutions on a white board is an excellent way of learning that,

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.880
possibly reading a sort of simplified book about a topic.

00:00:23.879 --> 00:00:25.318
If you're helping historians,

00:00:25.318 --> 00:00:27.599
it would be a good idea to read a little bit of art history.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.235
If you're helping biologists,

00:00:29.234 --> 00:00:33.899
you probably want to learn something about the kind of biology you are doing;

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.229
genes, or protein folding,

00:00:37.229 --> 00:00:39.859
or cells, things like that.

00:00:39.859 --> 00:00:43.100
So you have to learn a bit so that you get the fundamental concepts.

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.505
Now, once you've gotten that,

00:00:46.505 --> 00:00:48.425
you should start simple.

00:00:48.424 --> 00:00:52.894
A lot of people try to build the perfect model of

00:00:52.895 --> 00:00:57.830
the users of the customers world that never works.

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:02.344
What you have to do is to build the simplest version of

00:01:02.344 --> 00:01:07.745
a few cases that you think you understand and then see if they work.

00:01:07.745 --> 00:01:11.120
They won't work, not the first time.

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.525
What do you then do is you learn from this experience.

00:01:14.525 --> 00:01:17.389
You have the customers,

00:01:17.388 --> 00:01:19.174
users, whatever you call them,

00:01:19.174 --> 00:01:23.390
tell you what you got slightly wrong and then you extend them

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.844
a little bit with the right facilities or fix them if they were wrong.

00:01:27.844 --> 00:01:31.219
So basically, this is basic engineering.

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:33.620
You build something, you try it out,

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:34.984
you rely on feedback,

00:01:34.984 --> 00:01:39.789
and then you evolve the system based on that.

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:43.895
Working perfectly the first time is an old joke.

00:01:43.894 --> 00:01:46.969
It's a good joke and it's well worth remembering and

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:50.789
I'm reminding people of that and the last bug.
