00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.674
Over the course of this course,

00:00:03.674 --> 00:00:07.934
you've learned so many important features of C++.

00:00:07.934 --> 00:00:12.599
Classes are how C++ groups information.

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.129
Members of those classes store data and provide functions.

00:00:17.129 --> 00:00:21.390
Constructors instantiate objects of the class.

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.865
Classes encapsulate data and abstract how that data is used.

00:00:26.864 --> 00:00:30.854
Users of the class only need to know about its interface,

00:00:30.855 --> 00:00:36.119
not about the details of how the data is stored or how the functions are implemented.

00:00:36.119 --> 00:00:40.070
Inheritance hierarchies define how classes are

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.005
related to each other and any members they might inherit.

00:00:44.005 --> 00:00:47.673
Generic programming and polymorphism in particular,

00:00:47.673 --> 00:00:53.810
allow the same code to work with multiple different system defined in user-defined types.

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:59.359
This makes the code more reusable and saves you from having to repeat yourself.

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:03.379
You have learned so much about object-oriented programming,

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:10.510
this is part of what makes modern C++ really modern and surprisingly easy to use.
