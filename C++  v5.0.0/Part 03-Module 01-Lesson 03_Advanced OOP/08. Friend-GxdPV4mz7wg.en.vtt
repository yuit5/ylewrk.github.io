00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:08.054
The friend keyword grants access to the private members of a class.

00:00:08.054 --> 00:00:10.050
So in this class heart,

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.740
if we want heart to make

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.179
its private members accessible to the class human within the class heart,

00:00:18.179 --> 00:00:22.995
we'll say that class human is a friend of class heart.

00:00:22.995 --> 00:00:27.450
That way, class human can access private members of class heart.

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:28.890
So imagine we have a heart,

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.450
and the only thing heart has is a private member rate which is initialized to 80.

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.090
This is a human heart so,

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:39.315
80 beats per minute is its resting rate.

00:00:39.314 --> 00:00:44.009
There's no way to directly change the rate of a heart.

00:00:44.009 --> 00:00:47.030
That's something that changes in response to things humans do,

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.490
but you can't just think your way

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:52.625
to a better heart rate or command your heart rate to change.

00:00:52.625 --> 00:00:54.520
So how can your heart rate change?

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.690
Well, if the human exercises,

00:00:56.689 --> 00:01:01.589
then the heart rate may go up to 150 beats per minute.

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.575
So if we exercise, we want to be able to set the rate.

00:01:04.575 --> 00:01:07.519
But because rate is a private member of heart,

00:01:07.519 --> 00:01:12.229
the human class has to be a friend of class heart in order to be able to set that rate.

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:15.200
The same if we want to return what the heart rate is

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.439
through say an accessor function like heart rate,

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:21.155
then we need to be friends with

00:01:21.155 --> 00:01:24.515
the heart class in order to return that private member heart rate.

00:01:24.515 --> 00:01:31.954
Because human is a friend of class heart or heart declares class human to be its friend,

00:01:31.954 --> 00:01:36.739
class human is able to access the rate member variable and

00:01:36.739 --> 00:01:42.199
any other private member data or functions that might be present in heart.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.140
So if we compile this and run it,

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.909
we see that it works
