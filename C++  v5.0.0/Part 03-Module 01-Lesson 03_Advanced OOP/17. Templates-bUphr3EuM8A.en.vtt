00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
Templates are a tool for generic programming in C++.

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:09.164
Templates allow us to specify a generic type,

00:00:09.164 --> 00:00:12.269
in this example we'll call that type T,

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:18.239
and then use that generic type for the function signature and even within the function.

00:00:18.239 --> 00:00:22.049
So we have here a max function which is maybe

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.780
the canonical example of using a template and this max function takes two arguments of

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:32.130
type T. The first argument is called A and the second argument is called B and that

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:38.440
returns a value of type T. You can think of this T here as maybe being int,

00:00:38.439 --> 00:00:42.949
so it returns an int and it takes two arguments of type int

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:47.915
or it could be a double takes two arguments of type double and returns a double,

00:00:47.914 --> 00:00:52.670
or a float, or one of many other types of values.

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.140
In fact, when we call max in the main function we specify,

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.585
first that we're going to select int,

00:01:00.585 --> 00:01:07.515
or pass an int as the template type and so we pass in values of type Int, two and four.

00:01:07.515 --> 00:01:12.319
Then in the next call to max we specify that we're going to set

00:01:12.319 --> 00:01:17.464
the template type to double and we pass some values of negative 1.0 and negative 2.3.

00:01:17.465 --> 00:01:20.450
In the next called a max we set the template type to

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.475
character and we pass in the character A and the character B.

00:01:24.474 --> 00:01:29.780
When we compile and run this it all works and that's great.

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.620
We can have one function that accepts many different types of

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:38.215
arguments just depending on how we specify the type.

00:01:38.215 --> 00:01:41.975
If this looks familiar it's because it's the same syntax

00:01:41.974 --> 00:01:45.739
as you might see for some of the containers in C++.

00:01:45.739 --> 00:01:48.379
So things like standard vector use

00:01:48.379 --> 00:01:52.354
this syntax in order to specify whether we're creating a vector, ints vector,

00:01:52.355 --> 00:01:56.520
doubles are vector of some type of object and that's

00:01:56.519 --> 00:02:00.920
how containers work as they use templates to create

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.984
generic programming so that they can take

00:02:04.984 --> 00:02:11.219
many different types all using the same code for the vector class.
