00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.700
Generic Programming is an example of

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.290
polymorphism that generalizes the parameters of classes and functions.

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.054
By using a C++ facility called a template,

00:00:11.054 --> 00:00:15.780
you can build classes and functions that work with many different types of data.

00:00:15.779 --> 00:00:19.109
Think about the vector class from the Standard Library.

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.454
This is an example of generic programming.

00:00:22.454 --> 00:00:24.809
We can create a vector of ints,

00:00:24.809 --> 00:00:26.250
a vector of strings,

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.730
a vector of some user-defined class that we create.

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.625
We can have a vector of almost anything actually.

00:00:32.625 --> 00:00:36.509
You're going to learn more about templates and how to use them in

00:00:36.509 --> 00:00:40.379
generic programming to make your code more generalizable.

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:45.570
That way, you can reuse the same code in many different situations.
