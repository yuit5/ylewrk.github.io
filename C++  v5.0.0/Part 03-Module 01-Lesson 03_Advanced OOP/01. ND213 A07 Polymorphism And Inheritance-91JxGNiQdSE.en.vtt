00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.224
Inheritance and polymorphism are important principles of object-oriented programming.

00:00:06.224 --> 00:00:10.919
Inheritance is one way that classes can relate to each other.

00:00:10.919 --> 00:00:15.929
Two classes might have a parent-child relationship such that

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:21.074
the child inherits members from the parent. Here's an example.

00:00:21.074 --> 00:00:26.535
We might have an apple class that is the child of a fruit class.

00:00:26.535 --> 00:00:30.510
Apples have their own varieties and other members,

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:36.524
but they also inherit members from the parent fruit class like seeds, for example.

00:00:36.524 --> 00:00:42.449
Going further, the fruit class might be a child of the plant class.

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.880
The fruit class might inherit some members from the plant class,

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.385
maybe mass, for example.

00:00:49.384 --> 00:00:53.083
The plant class has a mass, so its child,

00:00:53.084 --> 00:00:57.415
the fruit class inherits this mass member, and therefore,

00:00:57.414 --> 00:01:00.289
the apple class which is the child of

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:05.325
the fruit class also inherits the mass member from the plant class,

00:01:05.325 --> 00:01:06.625
through the fruit class,

00:01:06.625 --> 00:01:08.239
to the apple class.

00:01:08.239 --> 00:01:11.929
Polymorphism is a related concept that

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:15.545
allows an interface to work with several different types.

00:01:15.545 --> 00:01:17.750
To extend our analogy,

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.010
we might have a cut function that can work with the plant,

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:24.395
the fruit, or the apple class.

00:01:24.394 --> 00:01:29.194
In fact, the cut function might accept totally different types of objects,

00:01:29.194 --> 00:01:32.269
like a rope or a paper object.

00:01:32.269 --> 00:01:34.339
On the other hand, we might have

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.960
a bruise function that works with fruits and with apples,

00:01:38.959 --> 00:01:40.579
but not with plants.

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:42.590
The fact that a function can work with

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:47.120
multiple different types of data is an example of polymorphism.

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:54.245
Coming up, you're going to learn even more about inheritance and polymorphism in C++.

00:01:54.245 --> 00:01:57.439
As always, you'll get to practice these topics in

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:02.280
several different examples and exercises. Let's get to it.
