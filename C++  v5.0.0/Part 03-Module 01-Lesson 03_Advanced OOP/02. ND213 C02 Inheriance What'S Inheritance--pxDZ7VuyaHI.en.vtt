00:00:03.529 --> 00:00:05.969
What's inheritance?

00:00:05.969 --> 00:00:13.664
That was the really hot thing in the 60s, 70s, and 80s.

00:00:13.664 --> 00:00:16.049
It's also very cool in the 90s,

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:17.820
when Java came along.

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:24.375
Its the basic idea that you build on top of something else.

00:00:24.375 --> 00:00:30.030
So, I believe the first example of the user inheritance was in

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:36.450
some modelling of emergency services in Oslo.

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.825
You want to read or write a simulation

00:00:39.825 --> 00:00:44.900
that allows you to estimate where you put your emergency services.

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:46.339
Here is a fire station,

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.785
here's a police station, things like that.

00:00:48.784 --> 00:00:52.909
For that, you have to built a model of the CT with streets,

00:00:52.909 --> 00:00:55.509
and you have to have things moving on them.

00:00:55.509 --> 00:00:57.989
You have vehicles moving on them.

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:02.115
Before inheritance, the way people were writing their code is,

00:01:02.115 --> 00:01:04.829
here comes a bicycle, it turns right.

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:07.829
Here comes a car, it turns right.

00:01:07.829 --> 00:01:10.700
You can't actually organize things like that.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.835
What you actually want to say is here comes a vehicle,

00:01:13.834 --> 00:01:17.824
and it turns right the way it wants to turn right.

00:01:17.825 --> 00:01:20.299
Car turns right in one way,

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:23.045
a fire engine turns right another way,

00:01:23.045 --> 00:01:26.480
police car may go through for red, and things like that.

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:30.875
So, the idea is that you build hierarchy of concepts,

00:01:30.875 --> 00:01:35.359
starting from the most general and then more and more specialized.

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:39.409
So, a fire engine is a kind of a truck,

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:43.189
that's a kind of a car,

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:45.799
that's a kind of a vehicle.

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:49.609
We can argue about whether a truck is a car,

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:51.984
but that depends on the design.

00:01:51.984 --> 00:01:54.450
So you build up these hierarchies,

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.365
and the typical thing is in graphics.

00:01:57.364 --> 00:02:00.170
You have a smiley face which is a circle,

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.030
which is a general shape,

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.189
and you built up like that.

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:11.270
This is one way of organizing your data,

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:15.665
and it's somewhat less popular now than it used to be.

00:02:15.664 --> 00:02:21.739
Because it turns out that a lot of our ideas aren't all that hierarchical.

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:23.840
There are some great examples,

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.745
and I think I just mentioned two of them,

00:02:25.745 --> 00:02:28.550
but people were using it.

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:31.685
They thought everything should be a class hierarchy.

00:02:31.685 --> 00:02:37.754
Most things aren't as hierarchical as they might think they were.

00:02:37.754 --> 00:02:41.498
A book has missed a lot of chapters,

00:02:41.498 --> 00:02:45.759
it gets a little bit more complicated.
