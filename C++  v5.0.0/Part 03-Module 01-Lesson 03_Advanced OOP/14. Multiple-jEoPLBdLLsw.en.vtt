00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.559
Multiple inheritance allows us to create a derived class from two different base classes.

00:00:07.559 --> 00:00:11.714
In this example, we have a class car and a class boat.

00:00:11.714 --> 00:00:16.605
Now imagine that we want to create a class amphibious car.

00:00:16.605 --> 00:00:20.429
This is like one of those duck cars that you might have seen that can drive on

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:25.140
the street and then drive into the water and float on the water.

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.949
So what we might do is we might create a new class,

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:38.310
AmphibiousCar, and that class will inherit from public boat and from public car.

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:42.859
Imagine we actually don't have that class do anything.

00:00:42.859 --> 00:00:47.344
It's just a class that inherits from both car and boat.

00:00:47.344 --> 00:00:53.629
One way we might test this is we might declare an object of type car and

00:00:53.630 --> 00:01:00.155
an object of type boat and an object of type AmphibiousCar and we might call that doc.

00:01:00.155 --> 00:01:07.390
Then we're going to assert that duck.Drive is equal to

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:14.795
car.Drive because both duck and car have access to this method drive.

00:01:14.795 --> 00:01:22.144
It's a method within the car class but because AmphibiousCar inherits from class car,

00:01:22.144 --> 00:01:25.219
users of amphibious car are able to

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:31.789
call the drive method on the object of the amphibious car class.

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:34.695
The same thing with cruise.

00:01:34.694 --> 00:01:44.399
We would say duck.Cruise is equal to boat.Cruise.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:50.760
That will call the method cruise that is in the boat class.

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:55.650
Now, if we compile and run this class,

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:57.045
we see that it works.

00:01:57.045 --> 00:02:02.180
Our AmphibiousCar object which we've named duck is able to both

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:09.939
drive and cruise just like the car and the boat.
