00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:12.449
A memory leak is when I get something from the heap,

00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:15.299
as a new Int.

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.414
Then I throw my pointer away.

00:00:17.414 --> 00:00:22.454
Now, nobody knows that that Int is still sitting over there and it leaks.

00:00:22.454 --> 00:00:24.269
I really don't like leaks.

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.954
Nobody likes leaks, nobody likes memory corruption.

00:00:26.954 --> 00:00:28.724
If you're doing, say, a Space Probe,

00:00:28.725 --> 00:00:30.675
you better not leak because then,

00:00:30.675 --> 00:00:33.329
well, you can't send impairments in Mars.

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.674
So leaks are really really bad news,

00:00:36.674 --> 00:00:41.079
and we can handle that with RAII.
