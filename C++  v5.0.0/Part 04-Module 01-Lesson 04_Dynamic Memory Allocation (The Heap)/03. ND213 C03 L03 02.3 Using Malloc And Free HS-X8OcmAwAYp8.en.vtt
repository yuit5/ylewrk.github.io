00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.180
Malloc and free are two flexible and easy to use methods.

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:06.000
Of some basic rules observed as shown in this section that can be

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.390
used to quickly and flexibly reserve and release memory on the heap.

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:11.415
With the introduction of C plus plus however,

00:00:11.414 --> 00:00:12.779
a different picture emerged here.

00:00:12.779 --> 00:00:14.789
Suddenly, there were object-orientation,

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:17.414
and classes, and constructors, and destructors.

00:00:17.414 --> 00:00:18.960
So the functions malloc and free from

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.990
the old C had to be replaced in most cases by the operators

00:00:21.989 --> 00:00:24.179
new and delete which were created especially for

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:26.550
the use in object oriented programming language,

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.210
and allows for such things as operator overloading for example.

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.240
Now in the next section, we will deal with these operators in much more detail.
