00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.520
In this section, we have learned about New and Delete as

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.835
powerful operators with whom we can effectively manage heap memory.

00:00:05.835 --> 00:00:07.139
Unlike malloc and free,

00:00:07.139 --> 00:00:10.800
New and Delete also called the constructors and destructors of classes,

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.429
which is essential for the concept of object orientation in C++.

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.254
In addition, both operators can be overloaded to accommodate their own functionality.

00:00:18.254 --> 00:00:21.529
Interestingly, malloc and delete still find an application after all,

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:23.984
as we have seen in the examples in this section.

00:00:23.984 --> 00:00:28.244
But as flexible and powerful as New and Delete are as dangerous there are as well.

00:00:28.245 --> 00:00:31.410
The language C++ has a reputation for being difficult and

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.185
sometimes even confusing with countless possibilities to make mistakes.

00:00:35.185 --> 00:00:39.679
This is not least due to the rules of dealing with new and delete and the flexibility of

00:00:39.679 --> 00:00:45.899
pointers as we will see in the next section on memory management problems. See you there.
