00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.320
Now, in this section,

00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:04.690
we will look at some of the most common errors in using new and delete.

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:06.720
These include things such as memory leaks,

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.975
buffer overruns, uninitialized memory, and several more.

00:00:09.975 --> 00:00:13.210
As we will see, some of these errors are made quickly and are hard to notice,

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:14.850
but have serious consequences for

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:18.045
the performance and also for the robustness of your programs.

00:00:18.045 --> 00:00:20.729
Finally, we will take a look at a tool will automatically

00:00:20.729 --> 00:00:23.535
find some errors like memory leaks in the code.

00:00:23.535 --> 00:00:25.780
Let's look at some errors here.
