00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.485
In this section, we will deal with memory management on the heap using new and delete.

00:00:04.485 --> 00:00:07.290
Note that new and delete are operators while malloc and free

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.109
are functions taken from C. We will compare in detail

00:00:10.109 --> 00:00:13.109
how malloc differs from new especially when allocating memory or for

00:00:13.109 --> 00:00:17.609
classes in terms of type security and when overloading operators.

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.660
Also, we'll look at a useful construct called placement new that can be

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.100
used to separate memory allocation from the actual object creation for more performance.

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:31.870
Finally, we will look at how arrays can be created with a new operator. So let's go.
