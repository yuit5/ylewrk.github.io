00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:09.419
In a language without garbage collection like C++,

00:00:09.419 --> 00:00:13.689
you didn't have to say 'Delete trash' to make it go away.

00:00:13.699 --> 00:00:20.309
My rule of thumb is don't use New and Delete in application code.

00:00:20.309 --> 00:00:24.794
New and Delete belongs in the implementation of your abstractions.

00:00:24.795 --> 00:00:27.075
So if you use a vector or a string,

00:00:27.074 --> 00:00:30.254
you don't use New and Delete, it's gone.

00:00:30.254 --> 00:00:33.329
It's hidden inside the abstraction.

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.460
That's where the pointers live,

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.609
in the part and on the fraction that actually touches hardware.
