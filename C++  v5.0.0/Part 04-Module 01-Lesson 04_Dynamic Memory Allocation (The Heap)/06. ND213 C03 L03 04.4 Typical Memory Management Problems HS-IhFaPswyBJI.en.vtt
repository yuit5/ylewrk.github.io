00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.609
Now, the problems mentioned here have given the programming language

00:00:02.609 --> 00:00:05.775
C++ a really bad reputation until about 2011.

00:00:05.775 --> 00:00:07.830
Especially, many beginners find it difficult to

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.199
navigate safely through this variety of rules

00:00:10.199 --> 00:00:14.699
and best practices imposed upon them by the standard prior to C++11.

00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:16.454
But since this version,

00:00:16.454 --> 00:00:19.439
C++11, much has changed in the world of C++.

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.020
The introduction of innovative concepts such as move semantics and

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:25.544
smart pointers have made the language more modern and less error-prone.

00:00:25.545 --> 00:00:28.215
Many of the above-mentioned problems occur only rarely

00:00:28.214 --> 00:00:30.975
with modern C++ if it is used correctly.

00:00:30.975 --> 00:00:32.219
In the following two lessons,

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.799
we will therefore deal in detail with move semantics and

00:00:34.799 --> 00:00:39.099
smart pointers and their correct usage. See you soon there.
