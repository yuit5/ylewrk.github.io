00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.759
Now, in this section we will deal with the methods, malloc and free.

00:00:02.759 --> 00:00:04.910
Both have been taken from the old C and are

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:08.009
an easy way to allocate and release the memory space on the heap.

00:00:08.009 --> 00:00:11.039
But although alloc and free have been around for several years,

00:00:11.039 --> 00:00:15.269
a deeper understanding of the mechanisms behind them is important for you to effectively

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.850
deal with new and delete as well as smart pointers

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.385
which you will hear much more about later on in this course.

00:00:20.385 --> 00:00:24.110
We will see how dynamic memory is reserved and used and also released.

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:28.109
We will also look at how already reserved and use memory can be made smaller or

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:33.549
larger by avoiding unnecessary data loss at the same time. Let's have a look.
