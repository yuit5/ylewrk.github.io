00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.569
Now the next section is discuss the different ways to allocate memory on the heap.

00:00:03.569 --> 00:00:06.889
We will look at the malloc and free command pair from the world of C,

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:08.580
and from there we will move on to

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.724
the new and delete operators introduced with C plus plus.

00:00:11.724 --> 00:00:14.160
For a deeper understanding of memory management,

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.065
it is important to look at both concepts.

00:00:16.065 --> 00:00:21.520
Therefore we will talk about malloc and free in the next section. So see you there.
