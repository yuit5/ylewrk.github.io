00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.379
Now, a big advantage of C++ is that the language is so hardware-oriented and

00:00:04.379 --> 00:00:08.535
programmers can make a lot of optimizations and manipulate low-level resources directly.

00:00:08.535 --> 00:00:10.830
But the problem is that this can lead to many errors

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.304
as well that are not always easy to locate.

00:00:13.304 --> 00:00:17.250
The stack memory we have encountered so far is comparatively straightforward to manage,

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.015
but the big challenges in memory management almost all concern the heap memory.

00:00:22.015 --> 00:00:24.539
These sections, therefore, provides an introduction to

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.349
this flexible and dangerous memory resource and briefly addresses one

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:33.280
of the many problems which is memory fragmentation. Let's have a look.
