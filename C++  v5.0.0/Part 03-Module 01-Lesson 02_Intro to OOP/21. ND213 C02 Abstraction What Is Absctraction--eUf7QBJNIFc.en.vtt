00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.640
Well, basically abstraction is

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:13.605
just getting away from the hardware and building on other things.

00:00:13.605 --> 00:00:20.385
If I have a string and a number and I want an address,

00:00:20.385 --> 00:00:26.820
I can build it out of strings and say integers with the name and address.

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.670
So I can basically sort of build up from previous things.

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.125
Each time you do that,

00:00:31.125 --> 00:00:37.269
you say you're abstracting from the underlying thing providing a new abstraction.

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:45.560
So from strings, I can build addresses and I can build file path support,

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:50.850
I can build log messages,

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.980
I can build just endless things you can build on top and that's called abstraction.

00:00:56.979 --> 00:01:00.469
Building more closer to the human and

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:05.709
the user needs than the basic stuff that's in the machine.
