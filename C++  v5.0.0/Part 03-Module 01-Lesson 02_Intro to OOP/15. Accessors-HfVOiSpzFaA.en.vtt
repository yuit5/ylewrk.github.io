00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:05.339
Accessor functions which are sometimes called getter functions,

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:07.650
are functions like this;

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:15.039
in day or in month or in year in this state class that get data from the function.

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:19.679
They are typically marked as constant because they are

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:24.329
designed not to change the interior state of an object and they

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:29.099
often just return a private member variable but

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:36.189
by channeling access to that private member variable through a public accessor function.

00:00:36.189 --> 00:00:40.964
We can better control in particular how that member variable gets set.

00:00:40.965 --> 00:00:43.370
We could take the year,

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:47.579
for example and make that a public member and then people could

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.625
set the year at will but if people do something like set the year to a leap year,

00:00:52.625 --> 00:00:54.829
that may actually change or

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:59.449
invalidate the number of days we have in a month for example if the date is

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:07.715
February 29th 2016 and then somebody goes and changes the year to 2017,

00:01:07.715 --> 00:01:14.525
that might that might break the date because February 29th 2017 isn't a valid date.

00:01:14.525 --> 00:01:19.010
So we make year a private member variable but that also means we need to create

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:26.390
this public accessor method that simply returns the value of year when it gets called.

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:31.234
Sometimes this accessor method would be named something like get year.

00:01:31.234 --> 00:01:35.075
I like to name it just year,

00:01:35.075 --> 00:01:36.829
with a capital letter,

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:42.379
which is a convention for member functions but it's

00:01:42.379 --> 00:01:49.199
the same name essentially as the private member variable that it returns.
