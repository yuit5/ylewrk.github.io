00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:05.594
What is encapsulation?

00:00:05.594 --> 00:00:11.189
Basically, if I want to write abstraction,

00:00:11.189 --> 00:00:14.519
then I would have it as a class and it will tend to have

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.405
some data and some operations on that data.

00:00:18.405 --> 00:00:20.490
If we go back again to the vector,

00:00:20.489 --> 00:00:24.000
it keeps the elements and then there's operations through to access

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.230
the elements like getting the 17th element or something like that.

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.119
Now, I don't really want my users to mess with my data,

00:00:33.119 --> 00:00:36.289
I want them to use the operations I'm providing.

00:00:36.289 --> 00:00:40.009
A constructor for using curtailing the vector,

00:00:40.009 --> 00:00:44.304
pushback for growing it by one element, things like that.

00:00:44.304 --> 00:00:48.560
So to protect my data against people sneaking

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:53.495
past the official interface and using the data directly,

00:00:53.494 --> 00:01:04.280
I provide what's called a public interface and private part the implementation details.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.564
So I say that the data has been encapsulated

00:01:07.564 --> 00:01:11.909
inside the object that provides the interface.
