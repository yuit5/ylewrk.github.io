00:00:04.429 --> 00:00:09.164
Basically, you look at your application domain.

00:00:09.164 --> 00:00:14.594
A programmer can't just be an expert at programming.

00:00:14.595 --> 00:00:16.905
You have to understand what it is,

00:00:16.905 --> 00:00:20.490
what the problem is that you have to solve.

00:00:20.489 --> 00:00:27.059
So you have to understand the world of your users, of your customers,

00:00:27.059 --> 00:00:31.229
and so you listen to how they talk,

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.759
and you see what are the concepts they deal with.

00:00:35.759 --> 00:00:42.299
So graphical people have shapes and rotations and certain forms of movements,

00:00:42.299 --> 00:00:46.474
and you then break that down in the things that you manipulate,

00:00:46.475 --> 00:00:50.870
like the shapes, and the operation should build onto those shapes.

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:57.739
Now you get various forms of shape classes or image classes and operations on them.

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:00.590
So it allows your customers to work at

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:04.655
the level they would like to work at using their vocabulary.

00:01:04.655 --> 00:01:06.469
What we do is,

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:09.799
we lift the language from the machine up to

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:14.724
the humans to make basically a language that's fit for humans,

00:01:14.724 --> 00:01:17.344
and that's a set of classes and

00:01:17.344 --> 00:01:21.140
relations between classes and operations on objects of classes,

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.159
and things like that.
