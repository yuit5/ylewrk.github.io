If you start out with C++ or any other language,

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.500
you get a fixed set of types.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.379
You have integers, you have pointers,

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:14.700
you have floating-point numbers,

00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:16.335
and that's about it.

00:00:16.335 --> 00:00:18.330
That's very impoverished.

00:00:18.329 --> 00:00:22.854
If I'm in sort of an engineering or mathematical mood,

00:00:22.855 --> 00:00:26.070
I would like to get complex numbers,

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.865
vectors with mathematical operations, matrices,

00:00:29.864 --> 00:00:34.875
band diagonal matrices, triangular matrices, that works.

00:00:34.875 --> 00:00:38.869
But you can't build all of that into the language,

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:42.729
so you have to give people the ability to build their own.

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:45.939
That's what C ++'s classes are doing,

00:00:45.939 --> 00:00:49.399
and let me just point out that that was going in a mathematical direction.

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:50.570
Now if you'd gone to, say,

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.164
telephony, which I spent some time doing,

00:00:53.164 --> 00:00:56.659
you may want those things but you want things that are very unusual

00:00:56.659 --> 00:00:59.799
like dial buffers and things like that,

00:00:59.799 --> 00:01:01.504
so you go in a different direction.

00:01:01.505 --> 00:01:06.064
So each application area can build its own little world of types,

00:01:06.064 --> 00:01:10.325
core classes that helps them.

00:01:10.325 --> 00:01:15.185
That's how you get something that's manageable at a higher level than the hardware.

00:01:15.185 --> 00:01:19.004
By the way, I got the class idea from the language, Simula,

00:01:19.004 --> 00:01:20.640
where they first appeared,

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.814
people sometimes ask me why is it called class and not a type.

00:01:24.814 --> 00:01:28.189
The answer is that Kristen Nygaard and Ole-Johan Dahl who

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:31.909
did Simula were not computer scientists,

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:37.500
though they had a mathematical background,

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.239
so they called them classes because they knew what a class was.
