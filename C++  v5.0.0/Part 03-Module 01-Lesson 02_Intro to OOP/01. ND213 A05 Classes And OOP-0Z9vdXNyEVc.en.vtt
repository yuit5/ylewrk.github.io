00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.530
Classes are the fundamental unit of object-oriented programming in C++.

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:11.620
You've already worked with some of the built-in system defined

00:00:11.619 --> 00:00:16.214
C++ types like ints, floats and chars.

00:00:16.214 --> 00:00:20.024
Classes allow engineers, including you,

00:00:20.024 --> 00:00:23.024
to build user-defined types.

00:00:23.024 --> 00:00:27.479
If you're building software for a car dealership, for example,

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.280
you might want to build a class for sedans and

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:36.335
another class for trucks and another class for convertibles as well.

00:00:36.335 --> 00:00:39.814
Some of these classes might be connected to each other

00:00:39.814 --> 00:00:43.849
through relationships like composition or inheritance.

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:45.620
Toward the end of this lesson,

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:48.879
you'll learn about those types of relationships too.

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.204
Once you understand classes,

00:00:51.204 --> 00:00:56.780
you can instantiate an object of the class or even multiple objects of the class.

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.185
You might instantiate two sedans for example,

00:01:00.185 --> 00:01:02.405
each having a different color.

00:01:02.405 --> 00:01:08.439
There is a lot to learn and you're going to do great. Let's get to it.
