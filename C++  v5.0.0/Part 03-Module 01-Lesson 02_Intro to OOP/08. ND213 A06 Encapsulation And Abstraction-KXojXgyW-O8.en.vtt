00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.569
Encapsulation and abstraction are two of

00:00:03.569 --> 00:00:08.865
the core properties of object-oriented programming, they're also related.

00:00:08.865 --> 00:00:13.379
Encapsulation means that we bundle related properties together in

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.380
a single class and sometimes we protect

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.640
those properties from unauthorized or accidental modifications.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.225
Abstraction means that users of our class

00:00:24.225 --> 00:00:27.780
only need to be familiar with the interface we provide,

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:33.450
they don't have to know how we actually store member data or implement member functions.

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.220
Encapsulation and abstraction are related because

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:41.390
encapsulation groups relevant data together in a class,

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:46.210
while abstraction hides the details of how we work with this data.

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.935
All the user of a class needs to know is that we

00:00:49.935 --> 00:00:54.500
have the data and we provide an interface to interact with it.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:02.310
Coming up, you'll see how to practice both encapsulation and abstraction in C++,

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:07.260
then you'll try implementing these concepts yourself. Good luck
