00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.825
In order to instantiate objects in C++,

00:00:03.825 --> 00:00:06.870
we build and use constructors.

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.205
These are functions which construct objects of a class.

00:00:11.205 --> 00:00:16.004
All classes come with a default constructor which takes no arguments.

00:00:16.004 --> 00:00:20.280
But we can also define our own constructors so that there might

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:24.750
be multiple different ways to instantiate an object of the class.

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.489
As a rule of thumb,

00:00:26.489 --> 00:00:30.500
the constructor should initialize the data members of the class.

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.490
It's also a good idea not to have any complex logic in

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:39.425
a constructor because you want to ensure that the constructor does not fail.

00:00:39.424 --> 00:00:43.369
It's hard to handle errors that take place within the constructor.

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:46.459
Coming up, you're going to practice building

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.219
lots of different types of constructors. Here we go.
