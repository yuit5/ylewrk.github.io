00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.710
Now in this section, we have looked at

00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:04.740
the major differences between threads and processes.

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.250
The low overhead, and the ease of use is the main reason why threads are

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.719
the concurrency tool of choice in most major languages, including C++.

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.030
This is despite the potential problems caused by

00:00:15.029 --> 00:00:17.684
accessing shared memory, as you will soon learn.

00:00:17.684 --> 00:00:20.279
In the next section, you will learn how to start a thread,

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:24.820
and how to perform some work in parallel to the main thread. See you there.
