00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.910
Now, in the last section, you have learned how to pass arguments

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:05.550
to threads using the function collaborator and lambdas.

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:08.474
In this section, you will be looking at two additional ways

00:00:08.474 --> 00:00:11.820
which are variadic templates and member functions.

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.339
Let's start briefly with variadic templates.

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:18.535
Since the introduction of the C++ 11 Standard variadic templates,

00:00:18.535 --> 00:00:22.519
they allow the definition of functions that take a varying number of arguments,

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:26.419
which is exceptionally handy in many applications and also in concurrency,

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:30.730
because we can use them to pass several arguments to a thread.

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:32.509
Let's briefly talk about member functions as well.

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:35.945
As you have seen already, we can pass arguments to a thread by reference.

00:00:35.945 --> 00:00:39.424
But what if we wish to run a function other than the function call operator.

00:00:39.424 --> 00:00:42.529
Now that's what the second part of this section is going to be about,

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.755
running member functions of an already existing objects.

00:00:45.755 --> 00:00:47.405
Now please go ahead and take a look.

00:00:47.405 --> 00:00:49.620
See you down below.
