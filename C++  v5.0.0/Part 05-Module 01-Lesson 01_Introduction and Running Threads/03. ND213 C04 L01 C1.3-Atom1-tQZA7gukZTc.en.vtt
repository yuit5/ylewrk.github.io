00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419
Now in this section, you will write your first multi-threaded program

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:06.570
using the concurrency support or c plus plus 11.

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:12.030
Also, you will find out just how many hardware threats your system has to offer.

00:00:12.029 --> 00:00:15.869
And even though the code to do this as available in your virtual environment,

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:19.050
I would like to encourage you to run it on your native hardware.

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.780
If you have several computers and laptop or desktop,

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:23.820
try them all and look at the differences

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.100
with regard to the number of hardware thread supported.

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.890
For me on my MacBook Pro it's four hardware threads,

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.885
on my iMac Pro it's 20.

00:00:30.885 --> 00:00:33.960
Further down in this section we will be using the thread function from

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.030
the standard library to call a function and

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.835
perform some work in parallel to the main thread.

00:00:38.835 --> 00:00:40.469
Before we quit the program, however,

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.859
we need to wait for a worker thread to finish

00:00:42.859 --> 00:00:45.890
his work which is what the command join is going to be used for.

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.545
So please go ahead and write your first concurrent program.

00:00:48.545 --> 00:00:51.090
See you at the end of this section.
