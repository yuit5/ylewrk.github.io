00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.520
So you made it to the end of this section and now you know

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.205
some basic concepts of concurrency such as threads,

00:00:05.205 --> 00:00:07.769
multi-threading, thread management as in barriers,

00:00:07.769 --> 00:00:10.289
passing arguments as a threat at the time of the creation,

00:00:10.289 --> 00:00:14.099
and you have encountered your first and not last concurrency bug,

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.439
which came from accessing a shared memory location.

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.935
This is going to happen quite often in this course, accessing shared resources.

00:00:19.934 --> 00:00:21.809
But before we move on to the next lesson,

00:00:21.809 --> 00:00:24.059
I would like to introduce you to the lesson project

00:00:24.059 --> 00:00:26.789
which is going to be a concurrent traffic simulation.

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.969
So please move on to the last part of this lesson to take a close look and, yes,

00:00:29.969 --> 00:00:33.030
there will also be some tasks for you to do where you can directly

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.630
apply your knowledge and see if you understand threading already.

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.830
So see you soon.
