00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.040
So welcome to the end of this section.

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.490
I assume that your impression of writing a first concurrent program might have been,

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.935
now that was easy. Yes, you're right.

00:00:07.934 --> 00:00:10.094
Introducing concurrency is not hard,

00:00:10.095 --> 00:00:12.510
thanks to the C++11 Standard.

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.469
Also, putting a thread to sleep for some time is easy as well as waiting

00:00:16.469 --> 00:00:20.445
for it at the end of your program using a thread barrier using Join.

00:00:20.445 --> 00:00:24.609
However, you have already caught a first glimpse of the randomness of events,

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:26.399
which is one of the primary sources of

00:00:26.399 --> 00:00:29.429
error in concurrent programming, as we will shortly see.

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.969
So after this first brush with concurrency,

00:00:31.969 --> 00:00:35.310
please feel free to move on to the next section which will be about starting

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:39.969
threads with something called a function object. See you there.
