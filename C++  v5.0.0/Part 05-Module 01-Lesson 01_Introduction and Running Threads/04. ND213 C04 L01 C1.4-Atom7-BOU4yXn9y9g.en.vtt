00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.860
So now you know about Lambda functions,

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:03.120
and I hope you agree that they are

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.689
a super valuable tool which every programmer should have in his toolbox.

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.210
They're convenient and they are versatile,

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.455
and they can be used for many purposes also outside of concurrent programming.

00:00:13.455 --> 00:00:16.949
In the next section, we will take a look at two additional ways of starting up

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.774
threads with periodic templates and with member functions.

00:00:20.774 --> 00:00:22.079
Once you have mastered these,

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:25.049
you can choose from four ways and total for launching the thread,

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.539
and the last section of this lesson we will then focus on

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.689
launching threads and several threads all at once.

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:33.700
So see you there in the next section.
