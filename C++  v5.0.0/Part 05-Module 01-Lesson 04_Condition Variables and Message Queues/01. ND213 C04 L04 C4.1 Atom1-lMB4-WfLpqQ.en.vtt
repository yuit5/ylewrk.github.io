00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.685
At this point you should have a solid understanding of

00:00:02.685 --> 00:00:06.720
basic thread and of task management as well as of shared data protection.

00:00:06.719 --> 00:00:09.509
We have seen that data protection is a critical element in

00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:13.379
concurrent programming and after looking at several ways to achieve this,

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.350
we now want to build on these concepts even further.

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.630
Now the goal here is to develop a method for

00:00:18.629 --> 00:00:23.129
a controlled and finally range data exchange between several threads.

00:00:23.129 --> 00:00:26.574
In this lesson, we will build a concurrent message queue,

00:00:26.574 --> 00:00:31.160
and for you this means understanding a data exchange protocol that can be used in

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:36.215
a large number of scenarios where threads need to communicate efficiently and safely.

00:00:36.215 --> 00:00:38.660
Now before we can build the message queue however,

00:00:38.659 --> 00:00:42.049
you need to first understand some basic concepts such as

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:46.280
the monitor object pattern and condition variables.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.370
Now once we have our message queue ready at the end of this lesson,

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:52.099
you are well-prepared to start with a final product of

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.850
this course so don't lose any time and go ahead with the first section.
