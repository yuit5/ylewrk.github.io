00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.310
Now that we have created a generic version of

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.900
a concurrent message queue that can be used to pass almost any data type,

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.255
we want to apply this concept in practice.

00:00:09.255 --> 00:00:11.100
In the upcoming final project,

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.309
you will implement a new class called traffic light,

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:17.460
which is responsible for managing traffic at an intersection,

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.640
and the basic mechanism within each traffic light will be

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.060
a version of a concurrent message queue from the last coding example.

00:00:24.059 --> 00:00:29.649
So get yourself a fresh cup of coffee and see you in the final project.
