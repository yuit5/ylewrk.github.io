00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.439
Now, the infinite polling loop,

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:03.960
we have implemented so far does not work optimally.

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:05.429
As long as the program is running,

00:00:05.429 --> 00:00:08.084
the while loop will keep the processor totally busy,

00:00:08.085 --> 00:00:10.785
constantly asking whether the new data was available.

00:00:10.785 --> 00:00:13.349
You can verify this by using a system task manager,

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.899
and by looking at the CPU load of our program.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.455
In the next section, we will look at a better way to solve this problem

00:00:19.454 --> 00:00:24.129
without putting too much load on the processor. See you there shortly.
