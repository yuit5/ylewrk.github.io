00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.104
Once your project has built successfully,

00:00:03.104 --> 00:00:04.799
you can also try running the tests.

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:11.280
So the build directory after it is built contains an executable here test.

00:00:11.279 --> 00:00:14.859
So if we run that one.

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:22.620
You should see, that these tests are run and

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:27.570
that the tests have failed and then eventually there's a segmentation fault.

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.079
This happens because none of the code has been written yet,

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:33.780
but as you write code for your project,

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.590
if it's written successfully these tests will begin to pass and when you complete

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.580
the project you will see a passing suite of tests here.
