00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.080
Now let's have a look at model.h which is the header file for

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.855
the model class which is provided by the IO 2D OpenStreetMap.

00:00:07.855 --> 00:00:13.230
Example, this class stores all of the OpenStreetMap data that is read into

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.550
the program and it provides structs

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.420
for all of the objects which you might find in the OpenStreetMap data.

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:23.600
In particular, we see a struct for node, for way,

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:28.765
for road, railway, and other objects that come from OpenStreetMap.

00:00:28.765 --> 00:00:33.480
Below that there are getter functions nodes, ways, roads,

00:00:33.479 --> 00:00:36.384
buildings and these return the vector of nodes,

00:00:36.384 --> 00:00:40.174
vector of ways, and vector of roads that are stored in the model.

00:00:40.174 --> 00:00:44.189
Then at the bottom of this class there are some private methods.

00:00:44.189 --> 00:00:45.269
AdjustCoordinates,

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.995
adjusts the OpenStreetMap node coordinates as they read into the model.

00:00:49.994 --> 00:00:56.984
BuildRings is used for building objects in the OpenStreetMap model and LoadData does all

00:00:56.984 --> 00:01:00.259
of the heavy work of parsing the XML data and

00:01:00.259 --> 00:01:04.084
storing all of that data in each one of these vectors.

00:01:04.084 --> 00:01:06.769
So here we see the private vectors for nodes,

00:01:06.769 --> 00:01:08.935
ways, roads and so on,

00:01:08.935 --> 00:01:16.460
and some other private variables that are useful when reading the data into the model.

00:01:16.459 --> 00:01:20.809
The last variable metric scale is used to convert

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.980
the scale of the model to real-life meters and we will use that later on when we

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:28.730
want to compute the actual meters that we

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:34.350
traverse in the path from the beginning point to the end point of our path.
