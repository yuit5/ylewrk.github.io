00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
Now let's have a look at rendered.age which is the header file for the render class.

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:10.004
This header file was provided by the io2d OpenStreetMap example

00:00:10.003 --> 00:00:12.509
and remains mostly untouched except that we've

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.390
added a few methods for drawing the start position,

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:16.710
trying the end position,

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.825
and the path once you've created the path for your A-star search.

00:00:21.824 --> 00:00:24.119
In the beginning of this header file,

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:29.160
there is the class constructor declaration render

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:35.414
and a declaration for a display function which uses io2d to display the output surface,

00:00:35.414 --> 00:00:40.515
and then there are method declarations for building road representations,

00:00:40.515 --> 00:00:43.274
building land-use brushes, drying buildings,

00:00:43.274 --> 00:00:45.939
drying highways, and so on.

00:00:45.939 --> 00:00:48.484
Down at the bottom of this header file,

00:00:48.484 --> 00:00:52.865
there are io2d brush objects which are created here.

00:00:52.865 --> 00:00:56.750
So you see io2d brush, background fill brush,

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.380
building filled brush, water-filled brush, and so on,

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:07.920
and these are used to render different parts of the OpenStreetMap data.
