00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.355
Once your project has built,

00:00:02.355 --> 00:00:04.839
you can try running the project.

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:09.705
So if we ls in the build here,

00:00:09.705 --> 00:00:14.669
we see an executable OSM_A_ star_search.

00:00:16.489 --> 00:00:22.739
If we run that, you should see a map pop up with nothing on it.

00:00:22.739 --> 00:00:28.599
So no path has been created yet because you haven't written any code yet. That's it.
