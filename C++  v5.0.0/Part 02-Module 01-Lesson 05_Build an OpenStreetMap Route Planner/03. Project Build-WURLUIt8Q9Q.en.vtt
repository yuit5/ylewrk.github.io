00:00:01.159 --> 00:00:04.485
Now, let's try building your project.

00:00:04.485 --> 00:00:07.379
If you're using the workspace to build your project,

00:00:07.378 --> 00:00:11.109
you can go to the desktop by clicking here,

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.690
and you can open Visual Studio Code.

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:35.289
We can close these windows and then open a new terminal in Visual Studio Code,

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:42.390
and we will cd into the project and

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:49.929
make a directory called build.

00:00:49.929 --> 00:00:52.604
Then we'll cd into builds,

00:00:52.604 --> 00:00:55.229
and then cmake dot dot.

00:00:55.229 --> 00:01:01.714
Dot dot, since we're in build the CMakeLists.txt is one directory above.

00:01:01.715 --> 00:01:10.090
So dot dot points cmake to the CMakeLists.txt that's one directory above. So we enter.

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.185
This completes. Once you make completes,

00:01:16.185 --> 00:01:19.000
you can type make,

00:01:19.459 --> 00:01:22.339
and this will start building the project.

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.350
If this is the first time you've built the project,

00:01:24.349 --> 00:01:27.329
it may take some time.

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.430
That's it. Our project has successfully built.
