00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.569
What you've just done is awesome.

00:00:03.569 --> 00:00:07.410
You built a route planner in C++ that can

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.565
find a path between any two points on a real map,

00:00:11.564 --> 00:00:13.230
of a real city.

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.780
Along the way, you learned about data structures

00:00:15.779 --> 00:00:18.210
and algorithms from the C++ standard library.

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.255
Including variables, functions, vectors,

00:00:21.254 --> 00:00:24.000
maps, pointers, and references.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.644
You also implemented the A-star search algorithm,

00:00:27.644 --> 00:00:32.954
used build tools and weren't a little bit of object-oriented programming.

00:00:32.954 --> 00:00:39.644
These skills will be fundamental to you as a C++ engineer and the project you've built,

00:00:39.645 --> 00:00:44.025
a route planning application is something that people use every day.

00:00:44.024 --> 00:00:46.469
In the next course of this Nanodegree program,

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.024
you'll see object-oriented programming in depth.

00:00:49.024 --> 00:00:52.329
Later you will learn about memory management and concurrency.

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:54.674
There's a lot more to learn about C++.

00:00:54.674 --> 00:00:57.244
This course is really just the tip of the iceberg.

00:00:57.244 --> 00:01:00.709
Congratulations on completing this course.

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.320
We hope to see you in the next course, soon.
