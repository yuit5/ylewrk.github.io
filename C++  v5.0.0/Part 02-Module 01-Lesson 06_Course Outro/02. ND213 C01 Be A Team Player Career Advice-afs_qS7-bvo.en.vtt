00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:12.059
One thing I should probably mention because people forget it,

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:18.600
is that the most important things are done in collaboration with others.

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.895
You don't just do it yourself,

00:00:20.894 --> 00:00:25.559
and that means your communication skills are essential.

00:00:25.559 --> 00:00:29.759
You have to be the kind of person that people are willing to work with.

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.225
[inaudible] is not good for you.

00:00:33.225 --> 00:00:40.079
Learn how to express your ideas in speaking and in writing,

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:48.140
because your ideas are unimportant till you manage proceeding to convince people,

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.314
others, that they're good ideas.

00:00:50.314 --> 00:00:52.469
So that's important.

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.984
Then you have to learn to listen to others.

00:00:54.984 --> 00:00:57.765
For indication is not a one-ways thing.

00:00:57.765 --> 00:01:00.660
Be a person people want to collaborate with,

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:04.590
be a person that can express your ideas,

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:06.875
be a person that can listen.

00:01:06.875 --> 00:01:12.269
In computing, ensure English has to be pretty good in most cases,

00:01:12.269 --> 00:01:14.254
it's not my native language.

00:01:14.254 --> 00:01:17.839
So that's one of the things you have to pick up,

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.680
if you're in computer science and in software development.
