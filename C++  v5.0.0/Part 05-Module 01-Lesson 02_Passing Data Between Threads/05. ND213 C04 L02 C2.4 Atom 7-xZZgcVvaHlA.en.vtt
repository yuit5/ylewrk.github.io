00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
So data races are one of your primary adversaries in concurrent programming,

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:06.179
and they can hide very effectively because they

00:00:06.179 --> 00:00:08.625
do not show up every time a program is run.

00:00:08.625 --> 00:00:14.099
Maybe only one from 100 runtime executions can show up the concurrency bug.

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:15.615
Now, here's a useful tip for you,

00:00:15.615 --> 00:00:19.800
delaying threads using standard sleep for can help expose data races.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.130
We are doing this in many examples in this section also follow sections,

00:00:23.129 --> 00:00:26.039
and it's also useful for you during debugging.

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.244
One of the keys to thread safety as you have seen

00:00:28.245 --> 00:00:31.109
is to use move semantics in conjunction with uniqueness.

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.859
It is the responsibility of you as a programmer to ensure that the pointers

00:00:34.859 --> 00:00:38.835
through objects that are moved between threads are always unique.

00:00:38.835 --> 00:00:42.109
Also, you have seen how we can override the copy constructor to

00:00:42.109 --> 00:00:45.589
enable a proper deep copy of a proprietary data structure or class.

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:47.765
Let me give you one last piece of advice

00:00:47.765 --> 00:00:51.005
regardless of the circumstances when one thread is writing,

00:00:51.005 --> 00:00:52.265
and another one is reading,

00:00:52.265 --> 00:00:54.905
and the data which they access has not been protected,

00:00:54.905 --> 00:01:00.549
this is by definition a data race even if no faulty behavior seems to happen at the time.

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:02.489
Avoid this at all costs.

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:03.810
Also in the next lesson,

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:08.344
we will look at ways to properly protect share data so that data races will not happen.

00:01:08.344 --> 00:01:09.560
But before we get there,

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.420
let's take a look at the lesson project.
