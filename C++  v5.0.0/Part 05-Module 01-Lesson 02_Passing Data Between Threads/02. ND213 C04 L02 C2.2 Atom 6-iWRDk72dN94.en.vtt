00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060
Now, in this section, you have learned how to use a promise

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.285
future channel to pass a string between two threads.

00:00:06.285 --> 00:00:09.599
Also, you took a look at move semantics and the difference

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.914
to passing data by value and thus making a copy of it.

00:00:12.914 --> 00:00:15.269
Now, move semantics are used very often in

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.899
concurrent programming and it helps make your code much more efficient.

00:00:18.899 --> 00:00:21.000
So please do not shy away from it,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and also if necessary dig a bit deeper into it.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.425
Use it especially when it comes to our value references.

00:00:28.425 --> 00:00:31.725
This is a super useful concept and your code will benefit from it.

00:00:31.725 --> 00:00:35.429
Now, the nice thing about using futures is that you can determine the point in

00:00:35.429 --> 00:00:39.200
time when you want to retrieve the data by calling the Get function,

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.095
that can be very useful especially when you want to ensure

00:00:42.094 --> 00:00:45.399
that the result is only available at a certain point in time.

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:49.229
Now, there are two major drawbacks of promises and futures, however.

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:54.048
The first one is information can only be passed into one direction,

00:00:54.048 --> 00:00:56.259
that is from the worker to the parent,

00:00:56.259 --> 00:00:57.769
and the second disadvantage,

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:59.840
they are meant for one-time use only,

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.855
promises and futures are meant for single use only.

00:01:02.854 --> 00:01:05.899
At the later point we will talk about an alternative, but for now,

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.090
let's move on to the next section which is about

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.204
the difference between threads and tasks.

00:01:10.204 --> 00:01:12.539
So see you there.
