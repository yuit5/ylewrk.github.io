00:00:06.139 --> 00:00:12.884
Comments should be used to say things that you cannot do well in code.

00:00:12.884 --> 00:00:16.995
Obviously, the code tells you how something is done.

00:00:16.995 --> 00:00:21.990
It doesn't tell you what at a high level it's been done,

00:00:21.989 --> 00:00:24.089
or why it's being done.

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:28.109
So you have some code and it does a sort,

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.519
you'd like a comment that says,

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.670
"This is supposed to be a Shellsort."

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.539
Now, you can look it up in the book and see,

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:42.129
and check the code to see if it really does a Shellsort.

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:44.260
But without that comment,

00:00:44.259 --> 00:00:48.089
you don't really know what the code is supposed to do.

00:00:48.189 --> 00:00:53.390
So for things that you can't say well in code,

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.890
if there's a complicated piece of code,

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.689
explain what it's supposed to do.
