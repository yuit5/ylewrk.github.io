00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:08.265
You saw that a language is strongly typed

00:00:08.265 --> 00:00:13.900
if an object can only be used according to its definition.

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:23.609
By that definition, C++ is mostly strongly statically typed.

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.100
However, to deal with hardware,

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.965
sometimes you have to weaken

00:00:28.964 --> 00:00:33.200
the type checking because a lot of hardware is just a bag of bits.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.500
You want to allocate memory,

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.765
it's just memory till you save what type it is.

00:00:38.765 --> 00:00:43.460
In this in-between time where you grab some memory say from

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:48.844
the operating system or straight from the hardware until you make it of a given type.

00:00:48.844 --> 00:00:53.344
Well, it's a bag of bits and we wouldn't call that strongly typed.

00:00:53.344 --> 00:00:59.914
Similarly, there are ways of suppressing the type checking in C++.

00:00:59.914 --> 00:01:03.769
For instance, you have an integer and you want to make

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:08.070
it into a pointer to a device register.
