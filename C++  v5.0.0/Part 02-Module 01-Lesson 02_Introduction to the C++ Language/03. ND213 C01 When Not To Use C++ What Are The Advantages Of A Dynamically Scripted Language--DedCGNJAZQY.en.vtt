00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:08.189
Well, the advanced future of dynamic language is

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.064
exactly the mirror image of the advantage of a compiled language.

00:00:13.064 --> 00:00:15.059
You can get to run quickly,

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:21.585
and you can run all kinds of things even if they're not completely correct.

00:00:21.585 --> 00:00:25.605
So say, if you're doing a series of experiments with some data,

00:00:25.605 --> 00:00:28.964
generate some data, display it, generate data,

00:00:28.964 --> 00:00:32.835
change the algorithm, run it with a smaller dataset;

00:00:32.835 --> 00:00:37.109
it doesn't matter if it's 10 times or 50 times slower.

00:00:37.109 --> 00:00:41.479
But it is really nice that you don't have to go through the compiler step and

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:49.564
wait 30 seconds or half an hour to get the optimal code completely checked.

00:00:49.564 --> 00:00:54.594
So if you're doing sort of interactive experimental stuff;

00:00:54.594 --> 00:00:58.359
a dynamically checked language,

00:00:58.359 --> 00:01:01.429
JavaScript or Python or something like that,

00:01:01.429 --> 00:01:05.135
has an obvious and simple advantage.

00:01:05.135 --> 00:01:08.340
On the other hand, implement something like JavaScript.

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.335
You want to write a JavaScript engine,

00:01:10.334 --> 00:01:13.134
where do you write it in? C++ of course.

00:01:13.135 --> 00:01:19.330
So you don't actually ever use a system that only uses one language.

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:25.084
For big systems, that time went 30 or 40 years ago.

00:01:25.084 --> 00:01:28.009
You use combinations of languages,

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:30.980
and professionals know more than one language

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:33.125
so they can pick the right one for the task.

00:01:33.125 --> 00:01:34.415
Trend is getting hard,

00:01:34.415 --> 00:01:35.960
but as you get older,

00:01:35.959 --> 00:01:37.609
you pick them up anyway.

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:45.180
But let's start out with 3-5 and then you may feel that you can do something.
