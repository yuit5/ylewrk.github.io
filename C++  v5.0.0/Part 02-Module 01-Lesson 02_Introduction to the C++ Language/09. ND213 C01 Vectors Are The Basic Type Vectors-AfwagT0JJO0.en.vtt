00:00:04.429 --> 00:00:09.989
The core of most applications are some datatypes,

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.570
and you start with a really simple one.

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.300
The default one C++ is the vector.

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:21.554
It's simply a linear sequence of contiguously allocated memory.

00:00:21.554 --> 00:00:25.079
That's most useful data structure there is.

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:28.574
They are linked lists which people overuse.

00:00:28.574 --> 00:00:32.265
Sometimes they are necessary.

00:00:32.265 --> 00:00:40.649
Then, you have the hash tables and the maps for collections of data that's kept sorted,

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:46.719
so that lookup is much faster than lookup in other data structures.
