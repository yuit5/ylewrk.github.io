00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.250
Welcome to the first coding lesson,

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:04.500
an introduction to the C++ language.

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.290
The goal of this lesson is to get you up and running with

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.080
the basics of C++ including how to compile and

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.629
run a simple C++ program and how to write code with correct C++ language syntax.

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.600
In this lesson, you'll see the following concepts.

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.330
To get started, you will write and run

00:00:21.329 --> 00:00:26.909
your first C++ program and you'll also learn how to send output to the console.

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:33.119
Then you'll learn about variables and containers including different variable types,

00:00:33.119 --> 00:00:37.019
vectors, using the auto keyword,

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.055
and then we'll move to functions and control structures.

00:00:40.054 --> 00:00:41.839
So you'll learn about for loops,

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.630
how to write your own C++ functions,

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:47.390
you'll learn about if statements and while loops,

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.454
and then last we'll learn about data input,

00:00:50.454 --> 00:00:55.099
where you will read data from a file and parse data and process strings.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.550
There's one more thing, which is to define your own types with enums.

00:00:59.689 --> 00:01:01.729
By the end of this lesson,

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:04.295
you'll be able to read a text file representing a maze

00:01:04.295 --> 00:01:07.189
into your program and you'll be able to store the maze data.

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:10.129
You'll also be able to output a basic map of the maze with

00:01:10.129 --> 00:01:13.979
nice formatting and ASCII characters to represent obstacles.
