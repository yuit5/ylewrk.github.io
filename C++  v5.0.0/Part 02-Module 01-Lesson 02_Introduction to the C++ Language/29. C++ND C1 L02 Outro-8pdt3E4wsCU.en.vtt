00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.800
What you have done is awesome.

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.415
You are now able to write and run programs using basic C plus plus.

00:00:05.415 --> 00:00:10.199
In this lesson you learned how to compile and run a simple C++ program.

00:00:10.199 --> 00:00:12.509
You learned how to send output to the terminal.

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.879
You learned about variables and containers,

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.214
including variable types, vectors, the auto keyword.

00:00:19.214 --> 00:00:23.160
You also learned about functions on control structures, including conditionals,

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.565
loops, defining your own functions,

00:00:26.565 --> 00:00:29.085
and then finally, you learned about data input.

00:00:29.085 --> 00:00:31.230
So you are able to read data from a file,

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.390
and parse data, and process strings.

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.975
You also learned about defining your own types with enums.

00:00:36.975 --> 00:00:39.829
Along the way, you wrote code to read a maze from

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:42.549
a data file and you stored that maze in your program.

00:00:42.549 --> 00:00:44.945
Then you printed that maze to output.

00:00:44.945 --> 00:00:49.880
You defined your own types using an enum to add ascii character formatting to the output.

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:54.655
You now have the fundamental building blocks to write much more complicated programs.

00:00:54.655 --> 00:00:56.630
Coming up in the next lesson,

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:58.730
you'll learn some of the data structures and algorithms

00:00:58.729 --> 00:01:01.024
that the C++ standard library provides.

00:01:01.024 --> 00:01:03.140
So you can add the additional step of

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.974
finding a path from the start to the end of the maze.

00:01:05.974 --> 00:01:08.269
When you're finished, you'll be able to print

00:01:08.269 --> 00:01:10.579
the output with characters to show that start,

00:01:10.579 --> 00:01:13.709
end, the path steps.
