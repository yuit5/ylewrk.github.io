00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.485
Now welcome to the final project of the C++ concurrency course.

00:00:04.485 --> 00:00:08.175
Over the last weeks, you have made the transition from writing linear

00:00:08.175 --> 00:00:12.120
and synchronous code to becoming a concurrent programmer.

00:00:12.119 --> 00:00:15.138
You now know how to create parallel path of execution

00:00:15.138 --> 00:00:18.289
and how to exchange data between asynchronous threads,

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:22.019
and concepts such as standard async, mutexes, locks,

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:24.210
Lambdas, and Rvalue reference,

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.495
as well as move semantics,

00:00:25.495 --> 00:00:28.580
now belong to your toolbox and they will greatly enhance

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:32.094
the quality and the performance of the code you write.

00:00:32.094 --> 00:00:33.229
In the upcoming project,

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:37.344
you will extend the current traffic simulation that we have by a new concept.

00:00:37.344 --> 00:00:40.359
In addition to vehicles, intersections, and streets,

00:00:40.359 --> 00:00:42.740
the city needs traffic lights to manage the flow of

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:45.215
vehicles and it will be your job to develop them.

00:00:45.215 --> 00:00:47.460
So let's take a look.
