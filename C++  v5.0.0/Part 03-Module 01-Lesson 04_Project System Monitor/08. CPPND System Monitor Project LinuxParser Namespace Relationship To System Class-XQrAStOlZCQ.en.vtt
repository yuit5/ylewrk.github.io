00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.510
Interesting implementation question is,

00:00:03.509 --> 00:00:09.059
what the relationship between the system class and the Linux parser namespace should be?

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:11.040
So for example in the system class,

00:00:11.039 --> 00:00:16.214
we want to have a function that returns the uptime of the system.

00:00:16.214 --> 00:00:20.609
In fact, in the Linux parser namespace,

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.675
we have a function that returns the uptime of the system.

00:00:23.675 --> 00:00:26.195
So there are a few different ways you might approach this.

00:00:26.195 --> 00:00:33.424
The system class might have a member function uptime that simply is a passthrough,

00:00:33.424 --> 00:00:38.149
and the member function uptime within the system class

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:43.564
might just call the function of the same name within the Linux parser class.

00:00:43.564 --> 00:00:47.614
If you did that, then the system would store no data

00:00:47.615 --> 00:00:52.640
or the system class might cache or otherwise saved data.

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.759
Maybe when a system object is instantiated

00:00:55.759 --> 00:00:59.599
or when an update function is called or at some other time,

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:08.118
the uptime function of the system class object might call Linux parsers uptime function,

00:01:08.118 --> 00:01:11.105
store the return value of this function,

00:01:11.105 --> 00:01:16.090
and then whenever a system object has uptime called on it,

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.020
instead of going all the way through and parsing

00:01:18.019 --> 00:01:20.579
the whole Linux file system in order to get the uptime,

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:25.099
you might just return the locally saved or cached uptime value.

00:01:25.099 --> 00:01:29.899
You could do it at least one of those two ways and probably some other ways too.

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:36.140
It's really up to you how you want to implement the system object or the system class,

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.900
I mean how you want the system class to work together

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.719
with the Linux parser namespace functions.
