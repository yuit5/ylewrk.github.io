00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.334
Now that you've practiced building and instantiating classes,

00:00:04.334 --> 00:00:07.769
it's time to put your C++ skills to work.

00:00:07.769 --> 00:00:10.875
The final project for this course is to build

00:00:10.875 --> 00:00:14.279
a process manager for the Linux operating system.

00:00:14.279 --> 00:00:20.309
Linux stores data about the processes running on the system in lots of different files.

00:00:20.309 --> 00:00:23.954
You'll read from those files, structure the data,

00:00:23.954 --> 00:00:28.469
process it, and then format it for output to the terminal.

00:00:28.469 --> 00:00:32.129
This program will require many different classes to

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.730
handle different types of data and different tasks.

00:00:35.729 --> 00:00:40.459
Some of these classes are related through composition and inheritance.

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:45.049
Some of these classes can be merged by practicing generic programming.

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:48.140
This project is a perfect opportunity to

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.960
demonstrate your object oriented programming skills

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.840
in C++ and to use what you've

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:58.250
learned to extend the process manager and really make it your own.

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.465
I really hope you enjoy this project because once you're done,

00:01:02.465 --> 00:01:05.520
it's going to be awesome.
