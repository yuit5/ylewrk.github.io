00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:06.359
The central object of this project or class is the system class.

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.220
So let's open up system got h,

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.335
which defines the interface for this class.

00:00:10.335 --> 00:00:14.490
The system has a processor that we call CPU.

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:20.789
It also has a container or a vector of processes,

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:29.024
and it has functions to return memory utilization,

00:00:29.024 --> 00:00:31.559
up time, the total number of processes,

00:00:31.559 --> 00:00:33.524
the number of running processes,

00:00:33.524 --> 00:00:35.460
the kernel of the operating system,

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.340
the name of the operating system itself.

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:43.880
The actual CPU and processes are kept as private member variables,

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.750
and then there are these public accessor functions that return

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:53.030
references to those private member variables.

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.780
So that's the system class.

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:01.549
If we want to look at the implementation of that class,

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:06.319
we can open up system.cpp in the source file,

00:01:06.319 --> 00:01:16.969
and you'll see we have some fairly straightforward accessor functions.

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:20.209
Then all of these functions have a definition,

00:01:20.209 --> 00:01:25.030
even though the definition is often zeroed out or it's an empty string.

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.549
So all of these to-dos tell you what you

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:31.939
need to complete in order to get the project to actually work.

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:36.439
So for example, the memory utilization function here should return the systems actual

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:43.259
memory utilization instead of just 0.0 which is hard-coded in right now.
