00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.320
In this project, you're going to build a system monitor that resembles the program htop,

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:11.370
which is a standard program for monitoring Linux systems.

00:00:11.369 --> 00:00:14.969
So we'll start here with our project workspace.

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:17.339
You can also build this on your local computer if you

00:00:17.339 --> 00:00:20.969
have access to a Linux system on your local computer.

00:00:20.969 --> 00:00:23.699
I'm going to launch go to desktop here,

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.230
although you actually don't have to do that.

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.839
You could build the project within the workspace editor.

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:31.690
But I'm going to launch my desktop.

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:37.245
I'm first going to open the terminator.

00:00:37.244 --> 00:00:41.834
Let's just take a look at htop and what htop looks like. This is htop.

00:00:41.835 --> 00:00:44.250
It's a Linux system monitor.

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.030
There are a bunch of different things going on in htop.

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:52.130
The top half of the screen is monitoring the CPU,

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:55.445
and memory, and some system-wide data.

00:00:55.445 --> 00:00:57.799
So there are actually four CPUs on this machine,

00:00:57.799 --> 00:01:01.445
and you can tell that the load on each of them is fairly low.

00:01:01.445 --> 00:01:05.030
There's also a fair bit of memory,

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.415
and you can see the memory usage.

00:01:08.415 --> 00:01:10.430
Then in the bottom half of the screen,

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.690
you can see different processes that are running on the system.

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:19.879
The most intense processes at the moment have to do with VNC,

00:01:19.879 --> 00:01:26.899
which is the tunneling program that allows us to connect a Linux desktop to your browser.

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.340
So it makes sense that

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:34.415
VNC program would be putting the most strain on the system resources right now.

00:01:34.415 --> 00:01:39.965
This console output is using a library called ncurses,

00:01:39.965 --> 00:01:43.969
which is a type of graphical display output,

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:45.814
but for the terminal.

00:01:45.814 --> 00:01:48.049
We'll also use that for the project.

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:55.174
In the project, we've done all of the ncurses display interface work for you.

00:01:55.174 --> 00:01:58.879
But if you want to extend the project from what we've given you,

00:01:58.879 --> 00:02:01.799
you can do your own work in ncurses.
