00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.690
In order to capture data about a Linux system,

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:06.945
it turns out that what we need to do is read the file system.

00:00:06.945 --> 00:00:10.365
Most of the data about the status of

00:00:10.365 --> 00:00:15.929
a Linux system is stored in the file system often in the proc directory.

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.850
So if we look at what's going on in the proc directory here on the terminal,

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.054
we see lots of different sub-directories.

00:00:23.054 --> 00:00:25.634
There are directories with integral names.

00:00:25.635 --> 00:00:28.540
These directories correspond to different processes,

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:31.349
and the processes map to process IDs.

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:36.719
So the directory name is the process ID of each process,

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.570
and then there are other directories that correspond to

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:40.715
more general information about the system,

00:00:40.715 --> 00:00:43.910
and most of the information that we're looking for about

00:00:43.909 --> 00:00:48.244
the status of our Linux system is here within the proc directory.

00:00:48.244 --> 00:00:52.879
So in order to capture this information for our system monitor,

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.660
we've created a Linux parser header and source file,

00:00:56.659 --> 00:01:01.024
and an interesting thing about the Linux parser is it's not actually a class.

00:01:01.024 --> 00:01:04.849
There's not really any object level data or

00:01:04.849 --> 00:01:08.629
member level data that needs to be persisted within Linux parser.

00:01:08.629 --> 00:01:11.209
So instead, it's defined as a namespace.

00:01:11.209 --> 00:01:16.359
There are some constant strings basically some file system path

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:19.519
variables that are constants of

00:01:19.519 --> 00:01:21.049
the namespace and then there are lots of

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:23.480
different functions that live within the namespace.

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:27.170
But this is not a class for which we instantiate objects.

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:33.150
This is just a namespace within which we have represented different functions,

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.780
and if you look at the source file,

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.799
then some of these functions we've given examples of how to implement,

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:42.739
and some of these functions we've given dummy implementations

00:01:42.739 --> 00:01:47.429
that you'll need to go replace in order to get the project to work.
