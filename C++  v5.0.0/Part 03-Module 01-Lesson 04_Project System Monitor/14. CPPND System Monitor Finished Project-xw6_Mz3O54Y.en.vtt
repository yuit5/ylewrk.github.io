00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:06.870
I'm going to run again control shift P. I'm going to run Git clone,

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.314
and I'm going to clone down a new repository.

00:00:09.314 --> 00:00:17.019
This repository is going to be the repository for my personal solution to this project.

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:23.475
Just like before, we're going to have to put that in our VNC clipboard.

00:00:23.475 --> 00:00:28.100
Now we can hide the clipboard again when I

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:32.885
come back to the command palette and Visual Studio code,

00:00:32.884 --> 00:00:36.349
I can pull down this repository once again it's

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.335
going to ask me where I want to save this repository.

00:00:39.335 --> 00:00:43.625
I'm going to put it again in /home/workspace.

00:00:43.625 --> 00:00:47.619
We'll see we already have the system monitor project repository there,

00:00:47.619 --> 00:00:48.695
that's our starter code.

00:00:48.695 --> 00:00:52.920
I'm going to put my personal solution code in here.

00:00:53.259 --> 00:01:03.583
Visual Studio code says I want to reload the window,

00:01:03.584 --> 00:01:06.689
and then I'm going to open that folder.

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.594
It looks like unlike like last time it didn't prompt me to open by default.

00:01:10.594 --> 00:01:13.709
So we'll go to exactly where we stored it.

00:01:13.709 --> 00:01:18.104
We'll go back to /home/workspace,

00:01:18.105 --> 00:01:21.079
and then we want to open David's personal solution.

00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:23.730
So we'll say okay, open that.

00:01:23.959 --> 00:01:29.494
You can see we have here your pretty similar structure to the starter code.

00:01:29.495 --> 00:01:37.425
It's just that if you go into the source code files here something like system.cpp,

00:01:37.424 --> 00:01:39.259
sorry let me get that clicked right.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:43.880
Here I've filled out all of that starter code.

00:01:43.879 --> 00:01:48.369
So now if I create a terminal,

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:52.525
and I run make build in the terminal.

00:01:52.525 --> 00:01:56.750
Once again, everything should build.

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:01.645
Takes a little longer down because I guess there's a little more code there.

00:02:01.644 --> 00:02:08.905
I'll clear out the terminal and I'll run /build/monitor same program as before.

00:02:08.905 --> 00:02:12.819
Now we have something that looks a little more correct.

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:16.030
We have a CPU that's bouncing around

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.824
a little bit in terms of utilizations similar with memory.

00:02:19.824 --> 00:02:23.019
We can see data about the system,

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:26.090
then we can see data about the 10,

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:33.914
most intensively the 10 processes that are utilizing the CEO the most heavily.

00:02:33.914 --> 00:02:38.539
Not shockingly those processes here are: Slash users/share/code/code,

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:40.669
that's Visual Studio code.

00:02:40.669 --> 00:02:43.639
So Visual Studio Code is the program that's

00:02:43.639 --> 00:02:47.679
actually putting the most resources on the system right now as well as turbo Bi-an Z.

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.485
So that's where we want to get to by the end of the project and

00:02:51.485 --> 00:02:55.190
over the coming videos and

00:02:55.189 --> 00:02:58.550
text we'll talk a little bit about how we get from the starter code that we

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:03.270
provide to something that looks a little bit more like this when you finish the project.
