00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.094
So I'm going to close htop because we're not going to build exactly that.

00:00:04.094 --> 00:00:05.955
Instead we're going to build

00:00:05.955 --> 00:00:10.515
a system monitor program that is roughly like htop though a little simpler.

00:00:10.515 --> 00:00:12.240
To show you where we're going to start,

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.955
I'm going to open Visual Studio Code.

00:00:14.955 --> 00:00:19.530
This is a Microsoft open-source coding editor.

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:24.880
I'm going to close some of the default files that open here.

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:32.234
I'm going to clone in the starter code for this project.

00:00:32.234 --> 00:00:36.810
I'm going to hit "Control Shift P" which brings up the command palette.

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:42.995
I'm going to say the command that we want is to clone a repository and then I'm going to

00:00:42.994 --> 00:00:51.274
copy the repository link for the starter code and I'm going to paste it here.

00:00:51.274 --> 00:00:52.640
Oh, but nothing Pastes.

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.549
That's because with VNC in order to get

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:58.459
something to paste in we actually have to go to the sidebar over

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:04.769
here and we have to add what we want to paste it into our system-wide clipboard.

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:10.280
So now that we've added that in when I come back to Visual Studio Code,

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.204
I can paste in that repository link.

00:01:13.204 --> 00:01:15.739
I can hit "Return" for some reason, well,

00:01:15.739 --> 00:01:19.879
not for some reason but we're logged in as root right now.

00:01:19.879 --> 00:01:21.439
So our home directory is root.

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:23.989
That's a bit of an odd place to do software development.

00:01:23.989 --> 00:01:32.509
So I'm actually going to ask to do software development in slash home slash workspace.

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:36.785
I'll say, "Put our GitHub repository there."

00:01:36.784 --> 00:01:42.814
Visual Studio Code asked if it would like me to open the clone repository.

00:01:42.814 --> 00:01:45.185
I say, "Open the repository."

00:01:45.185 --> 00:01:50.825
Now here we have the repository for our starter code.

00:01:50.825 --> 00:01:56.609
I'm going to open up a terminal in Visual Studio Code.

00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:59.429
It says, "Don't run code as root user."

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:06.660
I understand it's a little bit of an exception because we're in our Udacity workspace.

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:11.300
So I'm going to pull a little bit of a slight of hand here because we're in

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.005
the process right now of updating the starter code for this project.

00:02:15.004 --> 00:02:17.284
So I'm actually going to check out

00:02:17.284 --> 00:02:20.469
a different branch by the time you're working on this code,

00:02:20.469 --> 00:02:24.740
all of this code should be in the master branch that you pull down by default.

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:27.659
But right now I'm going to check out the update branch.

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:29.870
Update here is just the name of a branch.

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.009
We could have named it anything.

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:34.049
We named it update because we're updating the code.

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:39.349
Now, we've switched to the update branch and you can see over here all of a

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:43.460
sudden we have lots of different directories

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:52.770
and a slightly more robust project organizational structure.

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:58.260
So now that we have the new starter code,

00:02:58.259 --> 00:03:00.030
I'm going to run make build,

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.025
which should build our starter code,

00:03:02.025 --> 00:03:06.390
and we'll see it's getting everything compiled.

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:09.500
The starter code should build out of the box although as you'll see,

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:10.819
even though it builds,

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:13.129
it doesn't work all that well.

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:19.294
Once it builds, it should create an executable in slash build slash monitor.

00:03:19.294 --> 00:03:21.109
That's here.

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:23.615
So it's in the build directory and then there's

00:03:23.615 --> 00:03:26.780
a monitor program that's the name of the executable.

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:28.370
When we run that,

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.435
we get something that looks a little bit like htop

00:03:32.435 --> 00:03:37.849
but not as robust and nothing seems to actually be working.

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:39.754
We have the system date on the top.

00:03:39.754 --> 00:03:43.715
Then we have this process data on the bottom but everything's blank.

00:03:43.715 --> 00:03:47.890
So that's the starter code and what the starter code will look
