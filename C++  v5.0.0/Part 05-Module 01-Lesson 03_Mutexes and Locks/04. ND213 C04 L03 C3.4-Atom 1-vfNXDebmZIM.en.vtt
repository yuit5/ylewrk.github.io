00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.919
Now welcome to the third lesson project.

00:00:01.919 --> 00:00:04.544
The traffic simulation at this point works quite nicely and

00:00:04.544 --> 00:00:08.150
all vehicles are properly queuing before entering intersection one by one.

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:11.480
At least, that's the impression you might get from watching the simulation.

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:12.839
Now the problem, however,

00:00:12.839 --> 00:00:16.574
is that the instance of class waiting vehicles is a shared resource.

00:00:16.574 --> 00:00:19.859
It's shared by all the vehicles threads approaching an intersection.

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.390
As you have learned in this lesson,

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.185
when one thread is writing and another thread is either reading or writing,

00:00:25.184 --> 00:00:29.549
this is a data race regardless of whether we observe an error or not at the time.

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.830
Your job in this lesson project is to add

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:36.070
a safety layer which puts a halt to this data race.
