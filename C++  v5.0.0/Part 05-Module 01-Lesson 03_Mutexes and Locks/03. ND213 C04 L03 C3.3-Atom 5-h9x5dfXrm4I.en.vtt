00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.910
Now, lock guard and unique lock are two powerful concepts

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:06.120
that make it very easy to manage access to a shared resource.

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.060
They are both an extension of the basic mutex concept,

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:14.130
and differ mostly with regard to the flexibility of the locking and unlocking operation.

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.440
Now remember that mutexes should never be used

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.810
directly even though this technically works.

00:00:18.809 --> 00:00:21.449
The danger of a miss clock is simply too great.

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:22.905
It outweighs the benefits.

00:00:22.905 --> 00:00:24.195
So don't do this.

00:00:24.195 --> 00:00:27.690
One situation with lock guard and which lock guard does not cover is

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:31.390
a deadlock situation where one thread waits for another thread to unlock a resource,

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.670
or at the same time locking a resource for which the other thread waits.

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.800
Now this dilemma, where everything depends on

00:00:37.799 --> 00:00:40.829
the correct order of locking and unlocking the mutexes.

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.769
This can be solved by using

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.859
the standard lock operator as you have seen in the last example.

00:00:45.859 --> 00:00:51.090
So I think you're well prepared now for the next lesson project. See you there.
