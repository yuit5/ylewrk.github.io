00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.650
A well written ReadMe is one of the most
important parts of a good repository.

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.350
The reading is necessary for
others because it tells people

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.550
what the code is for, how to build an
installer code, and how to contribute.

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.140
To teach you how to write a good ReadMe,

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:15.790
I'm going to hand you
off to my friend Walter.

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:16.774
&gt;&gt; Hey!

00:00:16.774 --> 00:00:17.898
&gt;&gt; Hey.
Nice to see you.

00:00:17.898 --> 00:00:18.890
&gt;&gt; Well, sure thanks for having me.

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:19.860
&gt;&gt; Thanks for coming.

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:23.310
So I have some students who need
to learn how to write ReadMe.

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.420
&gt;&gt; Well, that's perfect because
I teach a course on just that.

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:27.450
It's less than an hour long.

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:28.440
And it will teach you everything

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:31.240
you know about writing documentation for
humans.

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:31.740
&gt;&gt; Thanks.

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:37.040
So you'll find a link to Walter's
lesson in the instructor notes.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.640
When you're finished with it,
head back here and will continue.
