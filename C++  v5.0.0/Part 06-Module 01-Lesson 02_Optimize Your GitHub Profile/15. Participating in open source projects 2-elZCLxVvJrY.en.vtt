00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:03.520
Let's go over how you can start
contributing to open source projects.

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:06.810
This is one of my favorite libraries,
pandas.

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.630
Here we can see a list of
issues that users have created.

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.410
Contributing to the project can
be as simple as helping a user

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.220
with one of these issues.

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:17.890
Of course you can also
create your own issues.

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:21.390
These can be feature requests,
bugs you run into, or

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.190
things in the documentation that
you find unclear, incorrect.

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:27.840
Be sure to be nice this is all public.

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.350
As Art said, one of the best
ways to start contributing,

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:32.870
is by improving the documentation.

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:34.920
Here's an issue related
to the documentation.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.835
If you are working on this library,
you could take on this issue,

00:00:38.835 --> 00:00:41.770
fix the documentation and
make a pool request.

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:45.080
Finally you can create a list a
repositories you like by starting them.

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.020
Also if you watch for repository,
you'll be notified of any changes.

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:52.900
This is a great way to keep up with a
library you're interested in working on.
