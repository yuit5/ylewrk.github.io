Hi, again. Look through your recent commit messages,

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:04.650
if think about the formatting.

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.655
How can you make the messages more clear and helpful?

00:00:07.655 --> 00:00:12.775
Think about how you would format them using the guide in the previous reading section.

00:00:12.775 --> 00:00:14.340
Just mark this checkbox,

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.140
when you're ready to move on.
