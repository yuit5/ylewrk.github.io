00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.710
Welcome to our lesson on creating
a professional GitHub profile.

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:06.523
I'm Mat Leonard,
a course developer at Udacity.

00:00:06.523 --> 00:00:09.385
In this lesson you'll create or
update your GitHub profile for

00:00:09.385 --> 00:00:10.850
use as a portfolio of your work.

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:15.066
You'll also learn how to impress
recruiters by contributing to open

00:00:15.066 --> 00:00:16.236
source projects.

00:00:16.236 --> 00:00:19.814
If you don't have experience with Git in
GitHub please take Udacity's course on

00:00:19.814 --> 00:00:21.870
version control with git.

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:23.610
Just follow the link in
the instructor notes.

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:26.410
Then come back here when you're done,
and we'll work on your profile.

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:31.160
Artists use a portfolio to
hold examples of their work.

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.000
For instance, there's a couple
paintings in my portfolio.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.800
I call this Octopus On A Swing,
and this is Two Cellos and a Baby.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.060
Similarly, my GitHub profile is
a portfolio of my programming work.

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:44.270
You can use GitHub the same way.

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:46.730
To show off your work
to potential employers.

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:48.980
Your profile will also
show how you work.

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.890
Don't worry, we'll go through various
ways to make your GitHub profile

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:53.140
into a professional portfolio.
