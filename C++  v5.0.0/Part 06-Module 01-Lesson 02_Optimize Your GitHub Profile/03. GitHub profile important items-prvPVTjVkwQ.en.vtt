00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.410
Now, let's look at an excellent GitHub
profile through the eyes of a recruiter.

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:06.020
This is Scott Moss' profile.

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:08.540
He's a software engineer
here at Udacity.

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:10.940
Over on the left is
the personal information.

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:14.464
A picture with a friendly smile can help
recruiters make a connection with you,

00:00:14.464 --> 00:00:15.634
but it isn't mandatory.

00:00:15.634 --> 00:00:18.488
If you aren't using a picture of
yourself be sure to include a picture

00:00:18.488 --> 00:00:20.620
that somehow captures your personality.

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:22.220
But nothing crude.

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:26.040
Below is some general information and
a link to Scott's Twitter account.

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.850
Recruiters can look through Scott's
tweets to get a sense of the things

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:30.550
he's interested in.

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.540
Similarly, I have a link
to my personal blog.

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.215
Also, make sure your username
is something professional.

00:00:36.215 --> 00:00:37.195
Like your name.

00:00:37.195 --> 00:00:41.218
It's not a good idea to name yourself
after your favorite pop star.

00:00:41.218 --> 00:00:43.025
Okay, back to Scott's profile.

00:00:44.235 --> 00:00:48.102
Over here, we see a list of Scott's
most popular repositories..

00:00:48.102 --> 00:00:49.852
These are ranked by the number of stars.

00:00:49.852 --> 00:00:53.122
Which are given by other GitHub
users that like the repository.

00:00:53.122 --> 00:00:57.002
The descriptions are nice so that we
know what these repositories are for.

00:00:57.002 --> 00:00:59.372
To the right is a list of other
repositories that Scott has

00:00:59.372 --> 00:01:00.650
contributed to.

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:03.500
This is a clear indication that he
is involved in collaborating with

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.830
others on open source software.

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.200
Employers can look through Scott's
contributions to judge how well he works

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.420
on a team.

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.830
We can see that ngFx is really popular.

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:13.830
We'll take a look at it later.

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.710
Down here is the contribution chart,

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.030
this is one of the first things
a hiring manager is going to look at.

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:21.250
Each square is a day.

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.311
The darkness of the green indicates
how many contributions were

00:01:24.311 --> 00:01:25.167
made on that day.

00:01:25.167 --> 00:01:27.059
You can see that Scott is very active,

00:01:27.059 --> 00:01:29.750
making at least one
contribution most days.

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.790
It's pretty clear that Scott spends
a lot of time working with code.

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.050
A good sign to a recruiter.
