As you were working on the rest of your
nano degree, keep in mind that it's

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:06.640
a good idea to contribute somehow
to an open source project.

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:07.820
If you don't know where to start,

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:10.390
look through the documentation
if it's a typo.

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:13.370
Or if there is something in
the documentation that isn't clear,

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:16.100
create an issue about it and
ask for help.

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.497
Then you can rewrite that part and
make a poll request.
