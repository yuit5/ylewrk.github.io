00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.059
Now let's go through a few quick
fixes to spiff up your own profile.

00:00:04.059 --> 00:00:07.010
You can follow along as I fix mine.

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:09.370
This guy here, if you don't know,
is Andre the Giant.

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:13.160
Professional wrestler, actor,
and all around good dude.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:14.780
However I'm going to
need a better picture,

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:17.960
preferably of myself,
if I want to connect with recruiters.

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.900
Also, I'm missing a bunch of other
information like my name and

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.350
where I'm located.

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.900
Git Hub has given me a prompt
to flush out my profile

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.930
to help other GitHub
users get to know me.

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.420
Let's follow their advice.

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:31.280
I can edit my profile by
clicking through here.

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.461
Here's where I can upload a new picture.

00:00:39.918 --> 00:00:41.640
Then I fill out my information.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.450
My name, the URL of my blog,
company, and finally my location.

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.500
Now that I'm done with that, I can also
change the names of my repositories,

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:51.600
if any need a better name.

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:54.890
My repository names look fine.

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:56.705
If I did want to change the name,

00:00:56.705 --> 00:00:59.207
I click the repository
then go to Settings.

00:01:00.681 --> 00:01:02.570
Here's where you can change the name.

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.940
Also, don't forget to comment your code.

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:05.530
You'll, probably,

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.850
end up showing off a couple sections
of your code to an interviewer.

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.070
Make sure it's commented and working
