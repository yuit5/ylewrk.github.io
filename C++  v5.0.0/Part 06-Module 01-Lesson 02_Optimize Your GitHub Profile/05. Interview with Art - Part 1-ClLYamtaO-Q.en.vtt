00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:04.590
I'm here with Art Gillespie, an engineer
and a hiring manager here at Udacity.

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:06.350
Thanks for coming.

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:07.140
&gt;&gt; Thanks for having me, Matt.

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:08.410
&gt;&gt; Of course.

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:13.580
So what I asked you here for
is that I'm trying to teach

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.900
students how to use their GitHub profile
as a portfolio to show off their work.

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.680
So I want them to get a sense
of what a hiring manager or

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.690
a recruiter actually looks for
from their GitHub profile.

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:26.720
&gt;&gt; Okay, yeah.

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:29.220
&gt;&gt; So just start out.

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.170
What is your role as a hiring manager?

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:36.922
&gt;&gt; Well, as a hiring manager, really,
it's a collaborative role where

00:00:36.922 --> 00:00:40.248
I work with engineers on the team and
leadership,

00:00:40.248 --> 00:00:44.701
and we sort of figure out what
attributes do we value in engineers.

00:00:44.701 --> 00:00:46.630
We have amazing recruiters and
HR people.

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:50.620
We work closely with them to sort of
figure out how do we best screen for

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.280
those attributes and then of course,

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.000
I spend a lot of time
actually doing interviews.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.227
You know screening people, looking
at people's GitHub repos, at their

00:00:58.227 --> 00:01:01.090
LinkedIn's and what not and just trying
to get a sense of the candidates and

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:02.750
then making a hiring decision.

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.840
&gt;&gt; Cool, so
when you're looking at a GitHub profile,

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.510
what's the first thing you look at and
then why is it important.

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.790
&gt;&gt; Well yeah, the first thing I'd
look at is that sort of heat map of

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.570
the bottom with the activity,
the different shades

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.680
of green because that just gives me
a really good sense of does this person,

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.660
are they passionate about coding?

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:21.300
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And do they contribute often?

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.340
And it doesn't have to
be like all the time but

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.402
if you see like steady patterns and
I found that that just correlates

00:01:26.402 --> 00:01:29.426
with success in the workplace,
you know people that love to code.

00:01:29.426 --> 00:01:30.602
&gt;&gt; Awesome.

00:01:30.602 --> 00:01:34.990
And so
after your initial impressions like

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.450
you know looking at this activity chart,
so what's the next thing you look at,

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.050
like what else do you look at
to get a sense of the candidate.

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:43.260
&gt;&gt; Well for me,
the next step is just to say okay,

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:47.232
here are the repos they've created, here
are the repos they've contributed to,

00:01:47.232 --> 00:01:50.579
you know where have they done the
meatiest work and pick one of those and

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.211
just dig in and I'll just spend you know
sometimes an hour just reading their

00:01:54.211 --> 00:01:57.257
code and trying to get a sense for
the kind of engineer they are.

00:01:57.257 --> 00:02:00.129
I also sometimes just dig into you know,

00:02:00.129 --> 00:02:03.940
have they contributed to
other GitHub repos issues?

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:07.190
How do they interact with other people
in those discussions and what not.

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:08.729
Are they good collaborators you know?

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.090
Are they patient you know,
that sort of thing.
