Hi, I am back with Art and now I'd like
to get into commits and commit messages.

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:12.020
So commits are one of the main reasons
we use Git as a version control system

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:13.830
so you can make these
incremental changes and

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.400
you can see what changed every
time you make a commit, and

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.350
a very important part of
this is the commit message.

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:24.800
So why is the formatting of
the commit message so important?

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.269
&gt;&gt; I think that,
well formatted commit messages.

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:32.432
I find most important reasons to get
going because as you go through digging

00:00:32.432 --> 00:00:36.529
through people's code or your own code
trying to figure out what's wrong

00:00:36.529 --> 00:00:39.250
especially when you're looking for
a bug.

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:41.970
But somebody just want to know why
a line of code is the way that it is.

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:43.432
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; The first thing you're going to do is

00:00:43.432 --> 00:00:44.550
go and get blamed.

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:45.500
Awesome tool.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.787
And it's going to show you the committer
but also the commit message.

00:00:47.787 --> 00:00:52.057
And if that message is just like added
stuff, it gives you no context for

00:00:52.057 --> 00:00:55.910
why the code changed,
why it's there in the first place.

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:58.140
And that's super important.

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.450
It's super important for you as you
maintain your code down the line.

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:05.372
It's super important for people that
follow after you in maintain your code.

00:01:05.372 --> 00:01:10.210
And so, it's funny, I definitely
when I look at candidates and

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:15.170
when I dig through their GitHub I check
out to see sort of how thorough and

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:16.210
well they communicate-
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:17.160
&gt;&gt; in their commit message.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.950
It's really important.
