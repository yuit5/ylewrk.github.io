00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:04.170
Now we can check out one of Scott's
repositories to get a sense of his work.

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.450
Let's check out NGFX over here the most
popular repository he's worked on.

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:11.090
We can see here that Scott
made the most recent commit.

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:14.290
If we click through to the contributors.

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:16.370
It's clear that Scott has
written most of the code.

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.340
Going back to their repository, firstly
we see a short description of the code.

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:24.120
This is a library for
making animations with Angular.

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:27.780
He's also included a link to
a get hub page for the library.

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:30.761
These GitHub pages are easy to
create and very impressive.

00:00:32.213 --> 00:00:36.120
Here's the readme, one of the most
important parts of repository.

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.170
Its main purpose is to help others
understand and use the code.

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.050
A repository without a readme
has no starting point for

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:42.970
someone to understand.

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:45.870
It will come back to the read me
it deserves special attention.

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.600
Now we can scroll back up to look at
the most recent commits Scott has made.

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.600
Most of the recent commits are updating
the version number and other chores.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.140
But there are some features and
other additions too.

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.800
We could look through some of these
commits to understand how Scott

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:02.310
writes code.

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:05.040
But I'm not going to get into that now.

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.680
Next we'll hear from a hiring manager
at Udacity about what he looks for

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:09.500
in a good high profile.
