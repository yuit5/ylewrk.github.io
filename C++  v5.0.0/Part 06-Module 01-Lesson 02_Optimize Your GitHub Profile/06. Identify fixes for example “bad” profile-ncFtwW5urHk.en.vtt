00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:01.750
Now I'll go through the profile and

00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:05.760
give you my thoughts, the profile
picture seems a little juvenile.

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:07.470
And you can't see the face clearly,

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.070
it would be better to have a normal
picture without a crazy filter.

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:15.070
We also don't know what
this user's real name is,

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:20.130
the username acorn47 could be better,
something based off the real name.

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.860
There isn't any other
personal information either,

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:26.500
if I was a recruiter, I wouldn't
know how to contact this person.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.785
Or anything about this person really,

00:00:28.785 --> 00:00:31.675
descriptions of their repository
would be very useful here.

00:00:31.675 --> 00:00:35.415
So I can tell what kind of projects
this person has worked on, and

00:00:35.415 --> 00:00:38.385
finally we can look at
the contribution chart.

00:00:38.385 --> 00:00:41.405
There's a bunch of commits here,
then a couple commits later,

00:00:41.405 --> 00:00:45.225
this person appears to not have
spent much time writing code.

00:00:45.225 --> 00:00:47.355
It's possible they made
a lot of changes, but

00:00:47.355 --> 00:00:50.365
packed everything into one large commit,
that's not a good sign.
