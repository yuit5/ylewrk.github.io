Hi, we're back.

00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:06.840
So I've been wondering, how you know
if somebody is a good collaborator,

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.940
right, because these candidates
when they get their job,

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:14.510
they have to work with other
people on shared code basis.

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:18.327
So how do you know from a GitHub profile
if somebody is going to be a good

00:00:18.327 --> 00:00:19.292
collaborator?

00:00:19.292 --> 00:00:22.838
&gt;&gt; So one thing I do to screen people
for how they'll work well in a team or

00:00:22.838 --> 00:00:26.384
how well they work on our team,
is to sort of branch out from the GitHub

00:00:26.384 --> 00:00:30.545
profile and maybe start with the issues
on the repo that they've participated in

00:00:30.545 --> 00:00:33.359
and see how they've participated
in those threads and

00:00:33.359 --> 00:00:37.274
if they've commented in on poll requests
and whatnot and just get a sense for

00:00:37.274 --> 00:00:40.021
how they interact with other
engineers in the repo.

00:00:40.021 --> 00:00:44.798
Particularly one thing that I think is
really interesting is, whether they're

00:00:44.798 --> 00:00:49.295
patient with the kind of people who may
be newer to the community and then from

00:00:49.295 --> 00:00:53.931
there, let say you branch out and maybe
find if there's an Internet Relay Chat

00:00:53.931 --> 00:00:58.076
channel that they may have been related
to a repo and look at the logs and

00:00:58.076 --> 00:01:02.361
just see, are they're helpful,
are they kind, or are they patient and

00:01:02.361 --> 00:01:06.928
it's such an important signal because at
the end of the day, you really want to

00:01:06.928 --> 00:01:11.330
hire people that are going to work
well and be a good fit for your team.

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.973
So yeah, I spend a lot of time doing
that, just kind of digging in and

00:01:13.973 --> 00:01:16.840
seeing how they interact with
other engineers publicly.

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:17.680
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.781
So when you're talking about interacting
with other engineers publicly,

00:01:21.781 --> 00:01:24.095
you mean on open source projects, right.

00:01:24.095 --> 00:01:28.533
I know personally, it's very daunting to
start working on this big library and

00:01:28.533 --> 00:01:32.100
all these other really
intelligent people working on.

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.960
So how would you start, or what's your
advice for a beginner, a new programmer,

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.776
to actually start contributing
to these open source projects?

00:01:40.776 --> 00:01:42.740
&gt;&gt; It's a great point, Matt.

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.700
It's really daunting even for me,
and I know one thing that I do and

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.040
that I recommend people do to
just sort of break the ice with

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:56.937
a new project is like find some
documentation, even the ReadMe.

00:01:56.937 --> 00:02:00.690
One thing I love to do is actually go
through the ReadMe, clone the project,

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:04.560
try to build it, try to get it running,
following the steps in the ReadMe, and

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.904
then like try to clarify it based on
the sort of problems that I have,

00:02:07.904 --> 00:02:10.190
maybe it just needs to
be updated a little bit,

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.950
submit a poll request with
a few changes to the ReadMe.

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:14.255
Those almost always get accepted.

00:02:14.255 --> 00:02:16.500
[LAUGH] And
it's just a great way to break the ice.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.750
I mean, you're going to move
on to actually fixing bugs and

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.280
then maybe actually contributing
features, but just to sort of get into

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.280
that community and get over that
initial hump of feeling intimidated and

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.780
there's just so much code and
not knowing where to start,

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.670
I find contributing some documentation
is a great way to start.

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:30.170
&gt;&gt; Cool.
