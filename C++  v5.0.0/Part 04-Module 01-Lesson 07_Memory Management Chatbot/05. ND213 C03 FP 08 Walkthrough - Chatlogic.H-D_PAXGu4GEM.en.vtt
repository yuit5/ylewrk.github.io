00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.435
Let's look at chatlogic, in chatlogic.h.

00:00:03.435 --> 00:00:06.870
We have a very important distinction between data handles.

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.070
We have owned data handles and we have non owned data handles,

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.359
and the data handles which the student version of chatlogic owns

00:00:15.359 --> 00:00:19.934
are a vector of graph nodes or pointers to graph nodes and graph edges.

00:00:19.934 --> 00:00:22.544
This is going to change while you traverse to

00:00:22.545 --> 00:00:25.155
the final project the final version of the code.

00:00:25.155 --> 00:00:28.500
Now the ownership of edges lies with the chatlogic and you will

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.100
change this and one of the tasks who will come to this pointers.

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:36.855
So where the ownership of edges is moved into some of the nodes here,

00:00:36.854 --> 00:00:39.134
but for now chatlogic owns them both.

00:00:39.134 --> 00:00:43.504
Apart from that we have some handles to currentNodes, ChatBot and panelDialogue.

00:00:43.505 --> 00:00:47.135
We have some helper stuff here a proprietary type definition,

00:00:47.134 --> 00:00:52.250
a token list which you will see shortly when we look at load answer graph from file.

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.049
Also some Helper functions,

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:59.390
the templatized helper function and the proprietary functions for this class here

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.240
load autograph from file which is the main function which loads

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.795
the text file and converts it into this very elaborate graph structure.

00:01:05.795 --> 00:01:08.609
Then we have the function which sends a message to the ChatBot

00:01:08.609 --> 00:01:11.269
and we have the function which sends a message to the user

00:01:11.269 --> 00:01:16.189
from the ChatBot and we have this function here which retrieves the handle

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:18.409
to the image which is managed by the ChatBot

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:22.109
so it can be displayed in the graphical user interface
