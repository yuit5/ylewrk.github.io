00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
In this exercise, we will change the ownership model behind the graph edge instances.

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.879
Until now they are owned by Chat-Logic and the changes we want to apply now transfer

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.155
this ownership to the graph node instances to which the graph edges are connected.

00:00:13.154 --> 00:00:15.989
Please note that we do not want to use SharePoint as yet.

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.129
Please limit yourself to the use of unique pointers and implement the ownership in

00:00:20.129 --> 00:00:25.274
a way that the graph node only owns the outgoing edges leading to children in the graph.

00:00:25.274 --> 00:00:27.179
Now, the incoming edges are owned by

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:30.039
the preceding nodes which are parents to the current node.

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:33.975
Please make sure to use move semantics when transferring ownership

00:00:33.975 --> 00:00:39.039
from class chat logic into instances of graph node.
