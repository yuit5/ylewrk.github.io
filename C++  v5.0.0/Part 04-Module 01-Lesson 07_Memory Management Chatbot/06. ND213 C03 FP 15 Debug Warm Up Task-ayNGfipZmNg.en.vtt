00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.430
Have you noticed that the program crashed when

00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:05.144
I closed the window when leaving the program?

00:00:05.144 --> 00:00:07.740
Well, obviously, there is a small bug hidden somewhere.

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.210
It's a memory management bug,

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.540
which has something to do with improper maybe allocation,

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:14.654
maybe geo location. You will find out.

00:00:14.654 --> 00:00:17.339
Your first task, and it's a warm up task,

00:00:17.339 --> 00:00:19.739
will be to find this bug and remove it.

00:00:19.739 --> 00:00:22.589
This should familiarize you with the code and set you up for

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:26.759
the rest of the upcoming tasks 1-5 in the final project.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.960
Have fun debugging.
