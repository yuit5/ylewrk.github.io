00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.950
Let's look at chatgui.cpp.

00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:04.528
We have on it at the top, from ChatBotApp,

00:00:04.528 --> 00:00:08.820
and as you can see here, this instantiates the frame, which is then shown.

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.589
This is the constructor of the frame.

00:00:10.589 --> 00:00:12.320
There's nothing very interesting in here.

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.964
We instantiate the ChatBotPanelDialogue.

00:00:14.964 --> 00:00:16.189
We add some spaces,

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:17.760
and we add some GUI elements.

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.335
This is all not very interesting here.

00:00:19.335 --> 00:00:23.519
This is basically a boilerplate code to construct the graphical user interface.

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.050
Then it gets a bit more interesting.

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.460
This is the opener capture,

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.109
and when we press the Enter key after we have entered some text into the text control,

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:32.835
this userText gets captured,

00:00:32.835 --> 00:00:36.660
it gets added to a dialogue item in the panel dialogue,

00:00:36.659 --> 00:00:41.069
and then we send the user text to the chatbot via this line here.

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.420
In that panel dialogue,

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.344
we get the handle to the ChatLogic instance,

00:00:45.344 --> 00:00:50.339
and then we call it SentMessageToChatbot function in this ChatLogic instance,

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.680
and we simply send the string to it.

00:00:52.679 --> 00:00:57.034
We have to convert this proprietary string here to an stl string.

00:00:57.034 --> 00:00:58.609
This is what this line is about.

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:04.375
This mb_str is the wx widgets onboard function which we are simply using here.

00:01:04.375 --> 00:01:09.974
Apart from that, let's scroll down a little bit to a more interesting place.

00:01:09.974 --> 00:01:14.309
Here, this is when the ChatBotPanelDialogue gets instantiated.

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.799
The student called it a wrapper here,

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.679
so between these and closing tags; you, obviously,

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:20.790
in one of your tasks,

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.715
you obviously have to change something.

00:01:22.715 --> 00:01:26.750
In this case, we are instantiating the ChatLogic instance on the heap.

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.284
We us then setting the handle to the panel dialogue,

00:01:30.284 --> 00:01:33.170
this is the pointer to the current instance of the panel dialog,

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.659
and then we are loading the answer graph from the file.

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:37.099
We talked about this at length in

00:01:37.099 --> 00:01:40.069
the introduction during your view through the slide deck.

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:42.739
You know how the answer graph is structured,

00:01:42.739 --> 00:01:45.199
and for more details on all the nodes inside,

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.880
you can simply open up this file here,

00:01:46.879 --> 00:01:50.924
it contains all the necessary information on nodes and edges.

00:01:50.924 --> 00:01:55.204
That's basically what's happening here at dialogue item PrintChatBotResponse.

00:01:55.204 --> 00:02:00.439
These are all helper functions which do not have to concern yourselves with so much.

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:03.304
This line here, the ChatBotPanel dialogue item,

00:02:03.305 --> 00:02:07.220
this is one answer from the chatbot or one query from the user.

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:08.629
At this position here,

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:10.849
we have to decide what we want to do with it.

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:13.849
Do we want to load the image from the chatbot in

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:17.719
case the message is from the chatbot when this is false,

00:02:17.719 --> 00:02:23.194
or do we want to use a proprietary image which displays the user icon here?

00:02:23.194 --> 00:02:28.340
This query is about when the message is from the user use a proprietary bitmap,

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:29.569
if it's not from the user,

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:33.379
if it's from the chatbot use the data behind this handle,

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:36.069
which directly leads through the image,

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:38.894
which is managed by the moving chatbot,

00:02:38.895 --> 00:02:40.890
which is somewhere in the graph network.

00:02:40.889 --> 00:02:44.149
These are the two interesting items here in the ChatBotPanelDialogue item.

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.000
Apart from this, I know this is a lot of code here,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.824
but it's not the code which you must look into to solve the tasks.

00:02:50.824 --> 00:02:52.054
As I told you before,

00:02:52.055 --> 00:02:53.344
the positions in the code,

00:02:53.344 --> 00:02:54.469
which you have to think about,

00:02:54.469 --> 00:02:55.745
where you have to add something,

00:02:55.745 --> 00:03:00.879
are always very easily spottable by these enclosing wrappers here.
