00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.145
Let's take a look at the edges.

00:00:02.145 --> 00:00:03.464
The edges are here,

00:00:03.464 --> 00:00:05.445
and we don't have too much inside the edges.

00:00:05.445 --> 00:00:07.724
We have non node data handles,

00:00:07.724 --> 00:00:09.240
child node, parent node.

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.609
Actually, we don't have any owned data handles.

00:00:11.609 --> 00:00:14.160
So edges don't take on ownership of anything.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.760
They are simply intermediaries between two nodes, child node,

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.640
and parent node, and we have some proprietary members,

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.310
though we have an ID as for the graph nodes.

00:00:23.309 --> 00:00:27.599
We have in a list of keywords which is associated with the current edge,

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:32.280
which helps us decide whether we want to move along this edge or along another edge,

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:36.615
depending on the query which is posed to the chat bod by the user.

00:00:36.615 --> 00:00:39.510
We want look into the implementation right now.

00:00:39.509 --> 00:00:41.519
It's very similar to graph node,

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.390
apart from a few small differences here and there,

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.250
with regard to student tasks.

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.340
Let's open it up very briefly to show that it's

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:54.560
a very small function actually and it doesn't have any student tasks inside.

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.080
So you won't deal very much with graph edges,

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:59.670
at least not with the implementation.
