00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
In the current implementation of class chat logic,

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.129
all the graph node instances are accessible by a vector called underscore nodes,

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.995
where raw pointers to the nodes on the heap are stored.

00:00:10.994 --> 00:00:14.820
But when class chat logic or when an instance of class chat logic is destroyed,

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.490
delete has to be called on them to avoid a memory leak.

00:00:17.489 --> 00:00:19.529
This exercise will be about adapting

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:22.710
the vector underscore nodes in a way that the instances of

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.109
graph nodes to which the vector elements refer are

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.004
exclusively owned by the class chat logic.

00:00:28.004 --> 00:00:31.335
Please make use of an appropriate type of smart pointer to achieve this.

00:00:31.335 --> 00:00:33.870
We're required to make changes to the codes such that

00:00:33.869 --> 00:00:37.814
data structures and function parameters reflect these changes.

00:00:37.814 --> 00:00:40.469
When passing the graph node instances to functions,

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.699
please also make sure to not transfer ownership and try

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:47.315
to contain the changes to cause chat logic where possible.

00:00:47.314 --> 00:00:49.849
Use the C++ guidelines and smart pointers to

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.399
decide where changes are appropriate and where not.
