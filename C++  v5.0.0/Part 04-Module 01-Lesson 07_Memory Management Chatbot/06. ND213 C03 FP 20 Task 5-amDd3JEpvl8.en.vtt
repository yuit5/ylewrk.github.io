00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.700
This is the last task in the final project.

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.980
When you implement it, the rule of five in the second task,

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.589
you made preparations for what is to come now.

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.449
The task here is to replace the current instance of chatbot in class chat logic with

00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:14.639
a stack allocated variable that is created at

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.880
the bottom of the function load answer graph from file,

00:00:17.879 --> 00:00:20.879
and then move into the root node of the graph.

00:00:20.879 --> 00:00:24.029
With each new dialogue between chatbot and user,

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:28.170
the chatbot instance is moved from node to node using move semantics.

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.630
Please make sure that the class chat logic has

00:00:30.629 --> 00:00:34.229
no ownership relation to the chatbot instance,

00:00:34.229 --> 00:00:38.464
and thus is no longer responsible for memory allocation and de-allocation.

00:00:38.465 --> 00:00:42.140
Also please note that the member chatbot remains in the class chat logic,

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.450
so it can be used as a communication handle

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:47.015
between graphical user interface and chatbot instance,

00:00:47.015 --> 00:00:48.814
when it's moved through the graph.

00:00:48.814 --> 00:00:52.039
When the program is executed and you are having a dialogue with the chatbot,

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:53.884
there should be messages on the console,

00:00:53.884 --> 00:00:58.460
telling you which part of the rule of five components in class chatbot is called.

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.980
I wish you all the best with this last task,

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:05.609
and of course, with your future career as a C++ developer.
