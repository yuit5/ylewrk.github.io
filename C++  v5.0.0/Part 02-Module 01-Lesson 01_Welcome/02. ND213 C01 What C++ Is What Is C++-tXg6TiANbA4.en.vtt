00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:09.390
C++ programming language, and there's of course lots and lots of those.

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:18.929
C++ is a language that is used for the foundational parts of just about anything we do.

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:26.609
It's the stuff that sticks in-between the higher level software and the hardware,

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.870
and that's a much bigger part of the world than most people think.

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:34.859
So, we're having our picture taken with a camera.

00:00:34.859 --> 00:00:36.945
There's software in that,

00:00:36.945 --> 00:00:39.270
it's almost certainly C++.

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.865
As a recording equipment will quite often have C++ in it.

00:00:43.865 --> 00:00:48.910
So will the amplification and such that you use to replay this,

00:00:48.909 --> 00:00:54.229
and C++ started out in the telecommunications industry.

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:58.849
So of course, it's all over the phones and

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:05.780
the transmission of television and inside your cell phone and all of these places.

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.019
If you look at other programming languages,

00:01:09.019 --> 00:01:11.375
they tend to be implemented in C++.

00:01:11.375 --> 00:01:14.135
So if you use Java or JavaScript,

00:01:14.135 --> 00:01:22.515
they're running on a piece that's C++ skipping running and so it's basically everywhere.

00:01:22.515 --> 00:01:27.185
I was sad to see that the Opportunity Rover just died

00:01:27.185 --> 00:01:31.820
this week and it had C++ in it because well,

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:36.769
it was doing photography, recording,

00:01:36.769 --> 00:01:42.454
communications and also the autonomous driving subsystem or C++.

00:01:42.454 --> 00:01:45.899
So yeah, it's fun.
