00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.540
It's really useful. That is,

00:00:09.539 --> 00:00:13.529
there's so many things that are programmed in C++,

00:00:13.529 --> 00:00:16.019
and there's best programs in C++.

00:00:16.019 --> 00:00:18.884
Your camera's probably programmed in C++.

00:00:18.885 --> 00:00:22.245
Your cell phones have C++ on it.

00:00:22.245 --> 00:00:24.480
There's the new data,

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.760
science stuff has C++,

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.115
your self-driving cars have C++.

00:00:29.114 --> 00:00:30.779
There is C++ on Mars,

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:32.759
in the Mars Rovers.

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.609
It's all over the place.

00:00:35.609 --> 00:00:39.195
Doesn't really matter much what you're interested in.

00:00:39.195 --> 00:00:46.049
There will be a job for writing C++ in that field.

00:00:46.049 --> 00:00:49.250
It's a language with a lot of features.

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:56.994
So you can use it to learn the fundamentals of quite a few variations of programming.

00:00:56.994 --> 00:01:01.879
So you can learn how to work with data structures.

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.129
You can learn how to write algorithms.

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:07.739
You can write very high level generic code in it.

00:01:07.739 --> 00:01:10.699
You can fiddle with the bits of the hardware in it.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.240
A lot of languages are built to do one thing,

00:01:14.239 --> 00:01:19.159
or they protect you against some of the unpleasantness of the real world,

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:22.090
to the point where you can't actually learn how to deal with.

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:32.575
So C++ can be very useful as a learning tool to learn how to program.

00:01:32.575 --> 00:01:35.790
Then of course what you learned you can use.
