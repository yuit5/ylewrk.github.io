00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:09.419
As a person, I like to see C plus plus being used in

00:00:09.419 --> 00:00:12.464
interesting places like your camera there,

00:00:12.464 --> 00:00:15.900
the vast Roe was, telescopes.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.899
I work in the finance industry just now.

00:00:18.899 --> 00:00:22.890
A lot of networking is done in C plus plus.

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.539
In the games industry,

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:30.509
most of the graphics and the animation kind of stuff is in C plus plus.

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.535
So is most of the animation in Hollywood,

00:00:33.534 --> 00:00:35.724
by the way had forgotten about that.

00:00:35.725 --> 00:00:40.890
We mentioned cars, there's a lot of C plus plus in cars.

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.134
Bmw's C plus plus sharpened,

00:00:45.134 --> 00:00:47.429
had one of their cars,

00:00:47.429 --> 00:00:49.590
it's C plus plus that controls it.

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.285
They use the controls.

00:00:51.284 --> 00:00:58.759
In these days the self-driving cars a lot of that work is in C plus plus too.

00:00:58.759 --> 00:01:00.634
We are talking about energy.

00:01:00.634 --> 00:01:07.069
The iron industry uses it and the wind turbines are using it a lot.

00:01:07.069 --> 00:01:11.889
I was at one Denmark many years ago teaching C plus plus,

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.754
that some of the people have built the biggest wind turbines in the world.

00:01:15.754 --> 00:01:19.539
So one of the things I found really cool about C plus plus is,

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:21.460
whatever you're interested in,

00:01:21.459 --> 00:01:25.369
it's a very good way of getting in and

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:30.055
talking to people doing these interesting things and in interesting places.

00:01:30.055 --> 00:01:33.500
I guess a lot of the things such as more mundane,

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:38.165
but interesting things are the unusual things is what you've been told about.

00:01:38.165 --> 00:01:41.030
The smart watches, the smartphone,

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.439
or things like that.
