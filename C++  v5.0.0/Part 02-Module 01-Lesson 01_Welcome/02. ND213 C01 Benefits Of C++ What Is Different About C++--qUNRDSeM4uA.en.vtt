00:00:04.629 --> 00:00:11.274
C++ differs from most modern programming languages

00:00:11.275 --> 00:00:17.464
by working directly on the hardware and working very efficiently with the hardware.

00:00:17.464 --> 00:00:19.579
Then having done that,

00:00:19.579 --> 00:00:26.504
it provides really strong abstraction mechanisms that are very powerful, very modern.

00:00:26.504 --> 00:00:28.809
So that you don't have to deal with

00:00:28.809 --> 00:00:33.379
the low-level stuff all the time and you can still be efficient.
