00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:06.915
So why is C++ the choice,

00:00:06.915 --> 00:00:12.330
and even more becoming the choice in a lot of important fields?

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.230
We can look at embedded systems,

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.760
we can look at gaming,

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.765
we can look at finance,

00:00:19.765 --> 00:00:23.330
we can look at the self-driving cars,

00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:26.084
flights controls, and things like that.

00:00:26.085 --> 00:00:30.420
The fundamental reason is this ability to work well with hardware,

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.910
and the ability to handle complexity through

00:00:32.909 --> 00:00:36.689
abstraction because the programs are getting bigger these days,

00:00:36.689 --> 00:00:39.179
and you need to handle the complexity,

00:00:39.179 --> 00:00:41.530
as well as performance.
