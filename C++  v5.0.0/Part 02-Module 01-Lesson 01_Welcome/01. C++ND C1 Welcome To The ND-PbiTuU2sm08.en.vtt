00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.655
Hello. Welcome to the foundations course of the C++ Nanodegree program.

00:00:05.655 --> 00:00:10.785
I'm David Silver, and I lead the School of Autonomous Systems here at Udacity.

00:00:10.785 --> 00:00:13.949
Hi. I'm Stephen Welch and I'm a Content Developer here at Udacity.

00:00:13.949 --> 00:00:17.070
This is the first course of the C++ Nanodegree,

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.855
the foundations of C++.

00:00:18.855 --> 00:00:22.425
In this course, you'll be starting out with basic C++ syntax,

00:00:22.425 --> 00:00:25.380
variables and functions, and by the end of this course,

00:00:25.379 --> 00:00:28.004
you'll be writing code in multi-file programs.

00:00:28.004 --> 00:00:31.259
Throughout the course, you'll use a number of

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.520
the containers and algorithms provided by the C++ standard library.

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.030
These are core tools that every C++ developer uses.

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.204
I love the final project for this course.

00:00:43.204 --> 00:00:45.559
You'll use something called the A-star search

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:49.445
algorithm to find a path between two points on a map.

00:00:49.445 --> 00:00:52.310
As you're learning the basics of C++,

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:57.620
you will first use A-star to find a path through an ASCII grid with obstacles.

00:00:57.619 --> 00:01:00.379
Once you've mastered the basics,

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:05.900
you'll find a path between two points on an actual map using OpenStreetMap data.

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.380
If you've ever used an Internet mapping application and wondered

00:01:09.379 --> 00:01:13.329
how it builds a route from one point to another, this is how.

00:01:13.329 --> 00:01:15.439
You'll be able to show this project to

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:18.370
your friends and family and anyone else who's interested.

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:22.400
This first Nanodegree course has four lessons in addition to this welcome lesson.

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.950
In the next lesson, you'll see an introduction to

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.615
the C++ language where you'll cover C++ syntax, variables,

00:01:30.614 --> 00:01:33.869
functions and containers, and then you'll move on to

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:36.260
A-star search which is an algorithm that

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.245
you'll use to find the path between two points in your grid.

00:01:39.245 --> 00:01:42.435
You'll be writing A-star search on the ASCII grid first,

00:01:42.435 --> 00:01:46.579
and then you move onto a lesson which gives you some of the tools that you'll

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:51.140
need to write larger programs including header files,

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.575
pointers and references, build tools,

00:01:54.575 --> 00:01:58.085
and a brief introduction to classes and object-oriented programming.

00:01:58.084 --> 00:02:00.019
In the final lesson of this course,

00:02:00.019 --> 00:02:02.405
you'll build an OpenStreetMap route planner.

00:02:02.405 --> 00:02:04.835
If you have previous experience with C++,

00:02:04.834 --> 00:02:07.789
where you feel as though you already have a good grasp on a topic,

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:10.129
feel free to skip ahead to the exercises.

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:14.030
At the same time, if you feel like the content is difficult to understand,

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.555
we encourage you to reach out to fellow classmates or mentors for help.

00:02:17.555 --> 00:02:21.650
We can't wait for you to get started with this course.
