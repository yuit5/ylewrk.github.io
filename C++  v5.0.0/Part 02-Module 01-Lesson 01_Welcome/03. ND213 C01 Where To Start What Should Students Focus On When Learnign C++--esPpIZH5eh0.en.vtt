00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:06.120
I think first of all,

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.585
they should try and look at C++ as a modern language.

00:00:09.585 --> 00:00:19.770
Far too many have learned C++ as if it was just C or as if it was still 1985,

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:25.964
and that pains me a lot because it's much better these days.

00:00:25.964 --> 00:00:30.384
You look at it and you see how to use the abstraction mechanisms,

00:00:30.385 --> 00:00:32.445
you use the libraries.

00:00:32.445 --> 00:00:37.054
They are the standard library which is fundamental data structures,

00:00:37.054 --> 00:00:42.769
few algorithms, timing, regular expressions, that kind of stuff.

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:48.200
Then there are specific libraries for specific areas, the database interfaces,

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.900
you have specific graphic libraries,

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.729
animation libraries, and such.

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:56.354
So I think when you start programming,

00:00:56.354 --> 00:01:00.109
you stick to the fundamentals for awhile because,

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:02.509
well, the fundamentals are the fundamentals.

00:01:02.509 --> 00:01:04.825
You have to know your algorithms,

00:01:04.825 --> 00:01:06.420
you have to know your data structures,

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.730
you have to know a little bit of machine architecture if you want to write at that level.

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:13.310
Then, you're going to actually do something.

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.579
If you're writing video game,

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:20.825
you have to know what game's engine and the libraries that go in there.

00:01:20.825 --> 00:01:26.189
So you go through the fundamentals and then something specific to your interest.
