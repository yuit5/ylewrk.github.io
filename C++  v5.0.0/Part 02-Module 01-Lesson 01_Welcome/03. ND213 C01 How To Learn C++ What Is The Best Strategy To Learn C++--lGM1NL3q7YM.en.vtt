00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:09.900
I think first you need an overview of the language.

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:16.679
A lot of students dig in and want to know everything about some little detail.

00:00:16.679 --> 00:00:20.070
But the point is, they can't understand it until they

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.594
have a broader view of the language.

00:00:23.594 --> 00:00:26.129
As people go in and they see, oh, pointers.

00:00:26.129 --> 00:00:28.605
Great, I want to know everything about pointers,

00:00:28.605 --> 00:00:31.335
and why would you want to do that?

00:00:31.335 --> 00:00:36.719
They should be work together with classes and other data types,

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:43.469
and how do you do a traversal or a container and such.

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.670
You shouldn't obsess about one little thing,

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:47.645
or they go in and they say, well,

00:00:47.645 --> 00:00:53.120
there's 32 different basic arithmetic types.

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:55.449
It's probably right. I can't remember.

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:59.445
I mean, that's just the sew of little type or rules for conversion.

00:00:59.445 --> 00:01:01.920
Most of the time, I don't use all of those types,

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.715
and most of the time, I don't have to think about those things.

00:01:04.715 --> 00:01:08.310
So instead of digging into the little details,

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.230
pointers, how to do a class, hierarchy,

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:14.870
things like that, get an overview.
