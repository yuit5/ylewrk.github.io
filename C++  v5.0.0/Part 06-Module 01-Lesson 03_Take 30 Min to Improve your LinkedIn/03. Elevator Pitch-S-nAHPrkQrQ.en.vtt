00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.000
Regardless of which type of networking
event you attend, the number one thing

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.870
that will help you navigate all of
them is having a great elevator pitch.

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:10.530
Elevator pitches were originally
known as sales pitches and

00:00:10.529 --> 00:00:12.250
lived solely in the business world.

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:16.079
However, they soon became popular across
all industries because it was a way for

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:19.449
people to quickly communicate
the purpose and value of something.

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:22.669
Having a elevator pitch is invaluable
in your career development.

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:25.690
These short sentences will find their
way in your LinkedIn summaries,

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:28.580
in talking to a recruiter,
in small talk with friends, or

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:30.369
in requesting a promotion.

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:34.410
Elevator pitches also help outside of
networking, such as in a job interview,

00:00:34.409 --> 00:00:37.149
when the employer asks you why you're
applying or what you're interested in.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:42.330
I have to admit that I did not like my
first experience with elevator pitches.

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.259
I was at a professional development
event and was put in with a group

00:00:45.259 --> 00:00:49.929
of strangers, and we all had to respond
to the prompt, tell me about yourself.

00:00:49.929 --> 00:00:50.899
I was first.

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:51.979
I rambled.

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:55.464
I've locked a lot of that
experience from my memory, but

00:00:55.465 --> 00:00:58.378
I'm sure I sounded like this,
hi, I'm Trinh.

00:00:58.378 --> 00:01:03.230
I grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area,
and I go to school.

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:07.989
And I'm interested in education,
but I've never worked in education.

00:01:07.989 --> 00:01:12.030
And yeah, that's why I'm here today,
to help me make that transition.

00:01:13.989 --> 00:01:15.569
I was really embarrassed.

00:01:15.569 --> 00:01:17.397
Especially when everyone
else gave their answers and

00:01:17.397 --> 00:01:19.629
it sounded like they had
their life together.

00:01:19.629 --> 00:01:23.049
But it was also a great learning
experience because after hearing myself,

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:25.739
I kept thinking, why do I need
to tell people where I grew up?

00:01:25.739 --> 00:01:28.359
Is that really important for my career?

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:30.909
Why did they need to know that
I was transitioning careers or

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:32.670
that I was new to this industry?

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.810
I was at the event, doesn't that
mean I was already interested?

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:39.800
This experience taught me that if
I wanted to sound confident and

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:44.009
communicate well, I needed a concise
elevator pitch that showed what I wanted

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:45.480
and why I wanted it.

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.340
My elevator pitch now is,

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.710
I'm a project manager passionate
about personalized education.

00:01:50.709 --> 00:01:52.959
After working in non-profits and
public policy,

00:01:52.959 --> 00:01:56.399
I believe lifelong learning is
the solution to many societal issues.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.850
I'm excited to apply my teaching and
management skills at Udacity.

00:01:59.849 --> 00:02:03.009
So, let's dive in to how to develop an
elevator pitch with personal branding in

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.280
mind.
