Hey Chris.

00:00:00.857 --> 00:00:03.299
&gt;&gt; Hi Trinh.

00:00:03.299 --> 00:00:06.359
&gt;&gt; Over the past year that we've been
working together on the careers team at

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:09.990
Udacity, you've developed so
much, so many of our web apps, so

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.250
many of our data backend, and I was
really surprised when I learned that

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.460
you've actually only been a software
engineer for a year, and so

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.300
I'm just really curious
to see how you got here?

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:21.050
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:23.940
I've been a software engineer
at Udacity for a year,

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:29.780
and my career I guess started
a little bit more than ten years ago.

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:34.910
I was originally a admission counselor,
and I got into tutoring and teaching.

00:00:34.909 --> 00:00:38.379
I even did a stint as an administrator
working at a psychiatrist office

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:40.960
learning about medicine and
health insurance.

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.329
&gt;&gt; Well that's like a really
diverse background.

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:48.019
How did you end up from a psychiatrist
office to being a software engineer?

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.680
&gt;&gt; So, it was definitely a long,
winding road.

00:00:50.679 --> 00:00:51.350
I think for

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.260
me, I first got curious about software
engineering through teaching.

00:00:55.259 --> 00:01:00.549
I made some courses at Udacity, in math
and data analysis and product design.

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:03.099
And along the way,
I picked up coding skills, so

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.689
I learned a little bit about Python,
I learned JavaScript.

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:07.739
I learned how to think computationally,

00:01:07.739 --> 00:01:10.159
how to think kind of more
like a computer scientist.

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:12.829
And I've just been learning ever since.

00:01:12.829 --> 00:01:17.539
And for me, I think,
the biggest thing was trying to

00:01:18.769 --> 00:01:23.479
acquire all those skills and then
convince people that I had enough skills

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.660
to build something and
to contribute to a larger organization.

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:27.979
&gt;&gt; That's great that
you brought that up.

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:31.010
I speak with a lot of people about
their career development and so

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:32.290
many of them took the initiative,

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:36.990
like you, to learn on their own time,
some while they're working full time.

00:01:36.989 --> 00:01:40.280
But they still kind of face
a barrier in that the it's hard for

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.230
them to convince people that,
yes I am qualified and

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:48.049
yes even though I don't have background
in this job, I can still do it.

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:50.049
How did you approach that problem?

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:55.030
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean it's certainly a hard
one and I think it's easy to feel like

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.980
you're an imposter, or
you don't have enough skills.

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:02.650
And I think the biggest thing you can
do is one, practice, but also two,

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:05.780
tell yourself that you
are a software engineer.

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:06.879
Talk about your projects.

00:02:06.879 --> 00:02:09.150
Talk about them technically
with other people.

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:12.349
That will build your confidence
in your own abilities and

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:16.009
your ability to communicate
that you can do this work.

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:21.060
So I think for me, I know one of the
things that I had to do was just kind of

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.069
turn off that voice in my head
that says you're not good enough.

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:25.709
Or you don't know enough things.

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:29.590
Just turn off that imposter syndrome
entirely and talk about what I can do,

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:30.930
what I have done.

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.180
And that's what can really
help you get an interview and

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:36.830
succeed in those interviews.

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.956
&gt;&gt; A lot of people when they're
transitioning to a new career for

00:02:39.955 --> 00:02:43.562
the first time, it's really hard for
them to introduce themselves and

00:02:43.562 --> 00:02:47.228
package everything that you just said
about yourself into kind of a short

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:48.879
introduction to other people.

00:02:48.878 --> 00:02:51.658
So do you have any strategies on
how people can approach talking

00:02:51.658 --> 00:02:53.603
to other people about
their career change?

00:02:53.604 --> 00:02:57.141
&gt;&gt; Yeah I think one of the best
things that you can do is to use

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:58.429
an elevator pitch.
