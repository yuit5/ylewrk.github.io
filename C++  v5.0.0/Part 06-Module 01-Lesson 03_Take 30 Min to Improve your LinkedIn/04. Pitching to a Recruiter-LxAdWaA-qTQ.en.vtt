00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:01.399
Hi, I'm Chris.

00:00:01.399 --> 00:00:01.989
&gt;&gt; Hi, I'm Trinh.

00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:02.549
Nice to meet you.

00:00:02.549 --> 00:00:03.309
&gt;&gt; Nice to meet you too.

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:04.560
Are you a software engineer?

00:00:04.559 --> 00:00:07.330
&gt;&gt; No, actually,
I'm a technical recruiter at Udacity.

00:00:07.331 --> 00:00:09.400
&gt;&gt; Cool, I actually really like Udacity.

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.719
I'm taking a number of
Udacity's online courses.

00:00:11.718 --> 00:00:13.788
You guys have really helped
me learn at my own pace.

00:00:13.788 --> 00:00:17.850
And I love that I have
a flexible learning time.

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.060
&gt;&gt; That's really awesome to hear.

00:00:19.059 --> 00:00:20.657
Which projects have you been working on?

00:00:20.658 --> 00:00:23.211
&gt;&gt; So I actually recently
was building an application.

00:00:23.211 --> 00:00:26.570
That let's teachers share
student responses anonymously.

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:28.272
And it's been going really well.

00:00:28.272 --> 00:00:31.155
I'm trying to actually
add in graphic UL.

00:00:31.155 --> 00:00:33.054
Which is a fairly recent technology.

00:00:33.054 --> 00:00:35.435
So that way I can query
the data a little bit easier.

00:00:35.435 --> 00:00:38.394
&gt;&gt; It's actually pretty funny that you
mentioned working on an app like that.

00:00:38.393 --> 00:00:41.750
Because Udacity is looking into
developing something similar.

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:42.500
&gt;&gt; Very cool!

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:43.366
Could I get your card?

00:00:43.366 --> 00:00:44.201
&gt;&gt; Yeah, of course.

00:00:44.201 --> 00:00:45.407
I'd really love to hear from you.

00:00:45.406 --> 00:00:47.292
So send me an email after this mixer.

00:00:47.292 --> 00:00:49.329
&gt;&gt; Great, thanks so
much, nice to meet you.

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:49.920
&gt;&gt; Nice to meet you, too.
