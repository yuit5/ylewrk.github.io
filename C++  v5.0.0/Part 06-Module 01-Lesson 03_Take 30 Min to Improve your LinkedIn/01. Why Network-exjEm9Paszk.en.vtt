00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:04.689
Hi, I'm excited to work with you
on using networking to find more

00:00:04.689 --> 00:00:06.030
work opportunities.

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:09.060
The more people you know, or
the more presence you have online,

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:11.780
the more likely you'll be
able to find opportunities or

00:00:11.779 --> 00:00:14.029
have opportunities find you.

00:00:14.029 --> 00:00:16.109
I want to share a story with you.

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.369
The first time I networked
was when I was 13 years old.

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:21.710
I wanted to find an afterschool
job as a babysitter.

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:24.130
I asked my parents for advice.

00:00:24.129 --> 00:00:27.929
They told me to look at the classified
ads to see who was looking.

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:30.033
To post flyers at my
school to advertise.

00:00:30.033 --> 00:00:33.111
And to also ask my parents' coworkers
if they knew anyone looking for

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:34.479
a babysitter.

00:00:34.479 --> 00:00:37.519
I actually had a few people reach
out after seeing my flyers.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.278
But I got my first biggest in gig
from my friend of my mom's co-worker.

00:00:41.277 --> 00:00:45.369
I've also used the same networking
system whenever I search for a new job.

00:00:45.369 --> 00:00:49.059
Nowadays, instead of using
the classified section of the newspaper,

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:52.530
I search for opening on job
works like Indeed and Dice.

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.359
Networking gave me access
to more job works.

00:00:55.359 --> 00:00:58.420
I joined a lot of local professional
groups which have their own job works,

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:59.518
not open to the general public.

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:04.069
After college,
I moved across the country unemployed.

00:01:04.069 --> 00:01:06.650
And I got a job from a posting and
a local group list serve.

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.110
For most of my career, I would say
my LinkedIn profile was pretty bad,

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:13.519
because I didn't take it seriously.

00:01:13.519 --> 00:01:17.239
However, one day, I took the advice
from Udacity's LinkedIn course, and

00:01:17.239 --> 00:01:19.209
rebranded myself on my page.

00:01:19.209 --> 00:01:22.579
I got three emails from
recruiters that week.

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:25.840
Those recruiters found me because I
optimized my LinkedIn profile for

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.219
searches.

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:29.219
And instead of asking my
parents coworkers for

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:33.265
job leads, I attended meetups and mixers
to connect with people in the industry.

00:01:33.265 --> 00:01:35.599
And I have found job
opportunities that way.

00:01:35.599 --> 00:01:38.989
I found my current job at Udacity
through a conversation with someone

00:01:38.989 --> 00:01:41.868
in the tech industry who I actually
didnâ€™t know all that well at the time.

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.189
You don't know where
opportunity will come from.

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:48.799
And the best way to make sure
you don't miss out on opening,

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:51.030
is to have a great online presence and
network.

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.959
In this lesson,
we'll review how to network and

00:01:54.959 --> 00:01:56.869
spend some time on personal branding,

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:00.050
which will make sure your networking
attempts lead to job opportunities.
