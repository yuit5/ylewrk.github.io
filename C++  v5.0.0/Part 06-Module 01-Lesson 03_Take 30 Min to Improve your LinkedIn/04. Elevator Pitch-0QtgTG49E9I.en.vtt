00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:04.009
As I was coming up with my elevator
pitch during my career change,

00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:05.919
I kept thinking about two things.

00:00:05.919 --> 00:00:08.560
One, what did I want
employers to know about me?

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:10.300
And two, what was I most proud of?

00:00:11.529 --> 00:00:14.889
I wanted employers to know that I'm
passionate about education, but

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:16.750
I wanted to be a software engineer.

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:20.000
I wanted them to know I worked
hard to get where I was then and

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.350
that I was worth taking a chance on.

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:24.380
Because if I got the job,
I would give it everything I had.

00:00:24.379 --> 00:00:27.710
So my elevator pitch ended up
being something like this.

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:29.170
Hi, I'm Chris,

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:32.740
a Full Stack Software Engineer who
loves building education products.

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:36.050
I recently developed a web app using
AngularJS that let's teachers share

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:38.189
student writing samples anonymously.

00:00:38.189 --> 00:00:39.862
I'd love to combine my passion for

00:00:39.862 --> 00:00:42.863
teaching and learning with my
software development skills to

00:00:42.863 --> 00:00:46.047
continue building personalized
learning products for people.

00:00:46.048 --> 00:00:49.252
My elevator pitch isn't something
I recite when I meet someone.

00:00:49.252 --> 00:00:52.590
That would be weird to say hi and
then just dive into the pitch, however,

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.530
I could write this pitch
as my LinkedIn summary.

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:56.600
When I'm talking to someone,

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.230
I communicate the points in my
pitch throughout the conversation.

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:01.889
Let me show you what that looks like.

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.280
Pretend in the next video that
Trinh's a recruiter and

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.209
I'm a job-seeker meeting her at
a mixer for education start-ups.
