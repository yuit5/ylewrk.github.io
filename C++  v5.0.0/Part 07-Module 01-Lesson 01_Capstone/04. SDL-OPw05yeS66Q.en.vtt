00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.879
In the project repo code that we provide,

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:08.355
we will be using the SDL or Simple DirectMedia Layer game development library.

00:00:08.355 --> 00:00:11.775
The SDL library is used to abstract the hardware

00:00:11.775 --> 00:00:14.699
so that you don't need to worry about interacting directly with the hardware,

00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:16.454
as you're writing your code.

00:00:16.454 --> 00:00:20.429
SDL manages video, audio,

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:22.980
input devices, and other components.

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.940
It provides you with a simple library interface to interact with these components.

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:35.070
SDL is widely used for game development and it can be used to develop games for Android,

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.429
iOS, Windows, OSX, Linux,

00:00:38.429 --> 00:00:40.234
and various other devices.

00:00:40.234 --> 00:00:42.825
Note that SDL is not a game engine,

00:00:42.825 --> 00:00:44.810
so it doesn't have the full development environment

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:47.060
that you might find with Unity or Unreal.

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:49.550
However, building games for the library first will

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:51.979
give you a better understanding of how games work,

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:56.509
and provide you with a fine-grained control of the language and game features.

00:00:56.509 --> 00:01:01.009
Additionally, the SDL library has been used to build thousands of games,

00:01:01.009 --> 00:01:05.230
including the popular Angry Birds and many games from Valve and Humble Bundle.

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:07.460
So let's get in started with installing SDL,

00:01:07.459 --> 00:01:10.349
so that you'll be able to build the project code.
