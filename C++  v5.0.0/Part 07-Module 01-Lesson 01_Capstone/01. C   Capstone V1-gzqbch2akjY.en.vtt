00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
Welcome to the Capstone project of the C++ Nanodegree Program.

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:10.740
By now, you're able to write C++ code using solid object-oriented structure,

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.505
efficient memory management, and concurrent techniques.

00:00:14.505 --> 00:00:18.675
This Capstone project will demonstrate your ability to

00:00:18.675 --> 00:00:23.220
independently create applications using a wide range of C++ features,

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.730
and the project you create will become an important part of

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.785
your portfolio to share with current and future colleagues and employers.

00:00:31.785 --> 00:00:36.020
You can choose from two options to create the Capstone project.

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.130
The first option is to build a project of your choice.

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:43.820
This is the most flexible option and this will allow you to

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.975
focus on the type of application that interests you the most.

00:00:47.975 --> 00:00:53.239
There are a wide variety of applications you could choose: a chatbot,

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:55.240
a neural network deployment,

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:57.580
a text-based solitaire game,

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:00.645
a microcontroller for an embedded system,

00:01:00.645 --> 00:01:03.540
a ROS Node simulated in Gazebo,

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:07.945
a networking protocol, a Mandelbrot or Fractal creator,

00:01:07.945 --> 00:01:12.285
a hot dog detector using OpenCV or a video game.

00:01:12.285 --> 00:01:14.270
There are a number of

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.810
different projects and tutorials online that can help you get started,

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:19.930
and we'll provide some links below.

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:26.480
We'll also provide a code repository with a CMakeLists.txt file and a "Hello, World!"

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.865
application that you can use to start.

00:01:28.865 --> 00:01:31.820
You can build from this repository if you wish,

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:33.635
but you aren't required to use it.

00:01:33.635 --> 00:01:36.005
We're excited to see what you can create.

00:01:36.005 --> 00:01:41.000
The second option for the Capstone project is to add features to a video game.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.095
We'll provide you with a simple two-dimensional Snake game.

00:01:45.095 --> 00:01:48.440
We adapted this game from a Stack Overflow post on

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.790
beginning game development with the SDL game programming library.

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:58.475
The game code provides a solid foundation for you to extend with additional features,

00:01:58.475 --> 00:02:04.070
or you're welcome to use the code as a framework to build your own game from scratch.

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.800
If you decide to build your own game,

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.505
cloning a classic 2D game is a great way to get started.

00:02:10.505 --> 00:02:14.580
Some possible games you might clone include Asteroids,

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.770
Pacman, Space Invaders, or Pong.

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:22.460
The game you create doesn't need to be a fully featured clone of the original,

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:25.730
but there should be enough of a game for a user to play.

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:30.230
Both project options require a solid effort from you,

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:36.090
but I am confident that you will be successful and we can't wait to see what you create.
