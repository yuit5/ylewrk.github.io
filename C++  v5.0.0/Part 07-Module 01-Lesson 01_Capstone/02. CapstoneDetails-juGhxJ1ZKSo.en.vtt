00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.029
In this video, we will go over the steps that you need to

00:00:03.029 --> 00:00:06.314
follow in order to complete your Capstone project.

00:00:06.315 --> 00:00:10.620
Step 1 is to identify the project you want to build.

00:00:10.619 --> 00:00:14.099
We recommend keeping the functionality as simple as possible

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.684
to start with so that the project doesn't become too big to complete.

00:00:17.684 --> 00:00:20.609
Note that it is fine to reuse code from

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.429
any of the courses in the Nanodegree as a starting point,

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:26.789
and you're also welcome to use the Snake game sample code to

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.989
extend with additional features or to build an entirely different game.

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:34.559
Step 2 is to scope the project.

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:38.655
You should sketch an outline of how you think your application will work,

00:00:38.655 --> 00:00:41.250
and then have a look at the rubric.

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.854
You want to ensure that your application will satisfy

00:00:44.854 --> 00:00:49.029
all the criteria for the "README" and "Compiling and Testing" sections,

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.995
and you also want to ensure that the application will satisfy

00:00:51.994 --> 00:00:56.099
at least five total criteria from the rest of the rubric.

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:01.505
Not all rubric items need to be satisfied in order to pass this project.

00:01:01.505 --> 00:01:05.850
You're free to choose the rubric items that you want to focus on.

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.395
Step 3, and this part should be fairly self-explanatory,

00:01:10.394 --> 00:01:11.924
is to build your application.

00:01:11.924 --> 00:01:14.829
Hopefully, this part will be the most fun.

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.515
Step 4 is to document your work.

00:01:19.515 --> 00:01:24.165
You'll need to write a short "README" indicating which project option you chose.

00:01:24.165 --> 00:01:28.645
The "README" should also include instructions for running the project,

00:01:28.644 --> 00:01:31.734
an overview of your code structure,

00:01:31.734 --> 00:01:37.219
and an explanation of how your submission satisfies the necessary rubric items.

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:41.900
Your "README" can be submitted as a markdown file or a PDF file.

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.630
If you plan on putting your project up on GitHub,

00:01:44.629 --> 00:01:48.199
it's probably a good idea to make the "README" as a markdown file.

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.829
Since then, that can be displayed on your repo homepage.
