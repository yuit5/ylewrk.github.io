00:00:03.529 --> 00:00:06.960
Why did I create C++?

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.219
I needed a language like it and it didn't exist.

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:16.789
I was trying to build a system which might very well become the first Unix clusters,

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:20.980
something like that, and for that I needed to manipulate hardware,

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:25.995
I needed to do memory managers, process schedulers, networking,

00:00:25.995 --> 00:00:31.089
interfaces and such and then I needed to abstract up,

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:34.250
so that you can say this bit runs over here and that

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.210
bits run over there and they communicate in this way.

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.840
What's a bit? You have to define it,

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.450
that's where the classes come in and they communicate in some way,

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.120
you can't just poke at memory.

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:51.329
You have to have a protocol and they have to follow it, that's another class.

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.719
So that's where it came from and I looked at what languages was available at

00:00:56.719 --> 00:00:59.104
the time and C was

00:00:59.104 --> 00:01:03.724
a good candidate for a really great language for dealing with low level stuff,

00:01:03.725 --> 00:01:06.829
hadn't been as popular as it became later,

00:01:06.829 --> 00:01:09.769
but anyway the support was great in hours on

00:01:09.769 --> 00:01:13.420
the same corridor as Brian Kernighan and Dennis Richie.

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:18.040
The other language that could handle the top stuff was similar,

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.024
could handle the abstraction,

00:01:20.024 --> 00:01:22.924
the only problem was it was far far too slow.

00:01:22.924 --> 00:01:29.179
Far far as many tens of times too slow and so I

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:36.180
took the class concept from Simula put it into C and the rest is history as they say.
