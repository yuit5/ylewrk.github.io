00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.334
This course has three main sections,

00:00:03.334 --> 00:00:06.429
an introduction to object oriented programming,

00:00:06.429 --> 00:00:09.429
a more advanced lesson on object oriented programming

00:00:09.429 --> 00:00:13.150
and a lesson preparing you for the course's final project.

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:16.185
In the introduction to object oriented programming,

00:00:16.184 --> 00:00:18.035
you'll learn about classes,

00:00:18.035 --> 00:00:23.164
which are the fundamental building blocks of object-oriented programming in C++.

00:00:23.164 --> 00:00:28.419
Classes evolved from a related type called structures or structs.

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:32.395
So you'll learn what distinguishes classes from structs.

00:00:32.395 --> 00:00:35.560
The introductory lesson will conclude with two of

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:38.094
the most important theoretical concepts of

00:00:38.094 --> 00:00:42.894
object oriented programming, encapsulation and abstraction.

00:00:42.895 --> 00:00:48.950
You'll learn what these concepts mean and you'll practice implementing them in C++.

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:51.640
When we move to the advanced lesson,

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.674
we'll start with two more important object oriented concepts,

00:00:55.674 --> 00:00:58.629
inheritance and polymorphism.

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:03.295
Polymorphism in particular can be implemented in several different ways

00:01:03.295 --> 00:01:08.290
and you'll build multiple approaches like overriding and overloading.

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:13.085
We'll conclude with exercises on templates in generic programming,

00:01:13.084 --> 00:01:17.394
which help make your code reusable in many different contexts.

00:01:17.394 --> 00:01:19.209
You don't want to repeat yourself,

00:01:19.209 --> 00:01:21.054
if you don't have to.

00:01:21.055 --> 00:01:24.950
We're about to learn a lot together.
