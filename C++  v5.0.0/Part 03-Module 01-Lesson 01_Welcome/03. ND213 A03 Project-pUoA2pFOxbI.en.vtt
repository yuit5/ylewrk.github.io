00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.040
Ermine has designed a terrific final project for this course.

00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.414
You'll develop a process manager for Linux,

00:00:03.414 --> 00:00:07.605
in particular a version of a program called Htop.

00:00:07.605 --> 00:00:10.660
Your program just like Htop,

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:15.414
will read and publish data about all of the processes on your system.

00:00:15.414 --> 00:00:20.364
You'll use C++ to read from files stored it into objects,

00:00:20.364 --> 00:00:24.384
manipulate those objects, and output data to the terminal.

00:00:24.384 --> 00:00:27.539
Building this program will allow you to work

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.009
with all of the different topics you'll learn in this course.

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:34.609
You'll develop classes to read and store data,

00:00:34.609 --> 00:00:36.659
you'll establish abstract in

00:00:36.659 --> 00:00:40.844
the encapsulated interfaces for objects to interact with each other.

00:00:40.844 --> 00:00:43.589
Some of the classes are related,

00:00:43.589 --> 00:00:46.064
which provides the opportunity to establish

00:00:46.064 --> 00:00:49.844
inheritance hierarchies and polymorphic class methods.

00:00:49.844 --> 00:00:55.409
You can even build generic templates to work with multiple types of data structures.

00:00:55.409 --> 00:00:59.099
This will be a pretty impressive program once you've finish

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.210
and a great project to add to your portfolio.
