00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.635
In the coming lessons,

00:00:01.635 --> 00:00:07.184
you will learn a lot about C++ and about object-oriented programming.

00:00:07.184 --> 00:00:10.515
It's not just enough to watch videos though.

00:00:10.515 --> 00:00:15.269
So there will be a lot of programming exercises for you to complete.

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:21.030
These exercises are super important for becoming a real C++ Engineer.

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:22.769
By the time we're finished,

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.079
you'll have done a lot of work,

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:30.914
but you'll also have a terrific grasp of object-oriented programming in C++.

00:00:30.914 --> 00:00:36.344
I hope you're as excited to work on object-oriented C++ as I am.

00:00:36.344 --> 00:00:38.269
So let's get started.
