00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:04.979
C++ is a compiled high performance programming language.

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.880
It's particularly important for applications that have to run really

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.589
close to hardware like robots or automobiles.

00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:17.609
C++ has a reputation perhaps unfairly earned for

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.780
being a complex programming language that's difficult to master.

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:28.050
It is true that C++ is a broad language with many different features.

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.990
In this program, you're going to learn the most modern and elegant features of

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:41.079
C++ so that you can write code that is both easy to develop and runs extremely fast.
