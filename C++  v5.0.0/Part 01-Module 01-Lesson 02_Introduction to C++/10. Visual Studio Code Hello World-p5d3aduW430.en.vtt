00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.940
Here I am with Visual Studio Code.

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:04.304
I've just opened the editor.

00:00:04.304 --> 00:00:06.509
I'm going to create a new file.

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:08.594
The first thing I'm going to do is save it.

00:00:08.595 --> 00:00:10.530
I'll save it in my temp directory.

00:00:10.529 --> 00:00:12.660
We'll call it hello.cpp.

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:23.199
I will write include iostream and create a main function.

00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:33.045
I'll say std cout ''Hello world''. Then I'll save that.

00:00:33.045 --> 00:00:36.690
The next thing I'll do is I will open up a terminal down here.

00:00:36.689 --> 00:00:38.699
I'll go to my temp directory.

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.304
I've already installed g++.

00:00:40.304 --> 00:00:43.484
So if I check, I have g++.

00:00:43.484 --> 00:00:48.375
So I can write g++ hello.cpp.

00:00:48.375 --> 00:00:50.869
That should give me an a.out file.

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:54.269
It does and it prints "Hello World". All set.
