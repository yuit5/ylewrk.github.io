00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.320
So here, we have a slightly more complex program.

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:10.574
This program declares a vector of strings called brothers.

00:00:10.574 --> 00:00:14.519
This is my brothers David, Ethan, and Adam.

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:20.625
Then we iterate over this vector and output the name of each of the brothers.

00:00:20.625 --> 00:00:24.769
If we run this,

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:33.144
let me make sure I'm in the right directory, g++ hello.cpp./a.out.

00:00:33.145 --> 00:00:36.190
So we say hello to David, Ethan, and Adam.

00:00:36.189 --> 00:00:39.919
What I would like to do now is try and debug this program,

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.530
just to inspect what's going on on each line.

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:47.545
So you might think I could come up here and start debugging, but in fact,

00:00:47.545 --> 00:00:50.240
Visual Studio Code is only set up out of the box to debug

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:54.484
Node.js which is not helpful for us as C++ developers.

00:00:54.484 --> 00:00:59.015
So I'm going to come to the extensions directory and search for

00:00:59.015 --> 00:01:04.094
C++ and I see the Microsoft C++ extension which is what I want to install.

00:01:04.094 --> 00:01:06.049
So now I've installed that.

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:11.504
I'm going to come back to hello.cpp and I'm going to try and debug again.

00:01:11.504 --> 00:01:15.399
Now I'm able to debug C++.

00:01:15.709 --> 00:01:23.030
When I start debugging I get nothing.

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:30.530
Let's try coming to the debug option here and select my environment.

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.945
Nothing happens.

00:01:32.944 --> 00:01:36.559
Here in the bottom right corner I see an error.

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:42.350
Please first open a folder to do advanced debug configuration.

00:01:42.349 --> 00:01:46.189
So I'm going to actually have to put hello.cpp in its own folder.

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:47.819
So let's open a folder.

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:51.919
I'm going to create a new folder within my temp directory called Hello.

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.790
Then I'm going to click okay.

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.420
Now I have this blank folder called Hello.

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.594
I'm going to move

00:02:01.594 --> 00:02:10.729
my hello.cpp file which was in the temp directory into this temp Hello directory.

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.834
So now I see I have hello.cpp all over again.

00:02:13.835 --> 00:02:20.064
Let's try just compiling it and running it here to make sure everything still works.

00:02:20.064 --> 00:02:23.104
All right. Now let's try debugging it.

00:02:23.104 --> 00:02:25.489
Let's say we want to stop at this breakpoint.

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:26.800
That's how we set a breakpoint,

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.355
is we put this red dot here.

00:02:30.354 --> 00:02:33.814
Next to the editor on the line that we want to stop the debugger at,

00:02:33.814 --> 00:02:35.854
we're going to say start debugging.

00:02:35.854 --> 00:02:41.989
Now I get this option for all the different types of debugging configurations.

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:48.165
I'm going to choose g++ build and debug active file.

00:02:48.164 --> 00:02:53.209
Actually I'm going to come over here and add a configuration here,

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:57.000
g++ build and debug active file.

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:07.200
So let's say I want to debug a.out.

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:16.000
Let's create

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.145
a launch configuration.

00:03:18.145 --> 00:03:25.969
Let's delete this and now let's debug.

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:36.819
Let's see. Now we have to load our symbols.

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:41.919
So it's not enough to just compile the file and build a.out.

00:03:41.919 --> 00:03:44.409
We need to compile the file with the debug symbols.

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:53.264
So we'll say hello.-g and we will run on that.

00:03:53.264 --> 00:03:55.259
Now you see we stop at

00:03:55.259 --> 00:04:00.409
standard cout hello brother and we can look at the status of the program.

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:02.780
We have these strings that are my brothers,

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:04.534
the active brother is David.

00:04:04.534 --> 00:04:07.389
If we continue to the next breakpoint,

00:04:07.389 --> 00:04:10.625
we see the active brother becomes Ethan.

00:04:10.625 --> 00:04:14.349
We can just step through the code to add them.

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:18.959
Now we're done. That's an example of how to debug a program.
