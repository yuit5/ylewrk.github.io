00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:10.275
C++ is the tool and the core guidelines is

00:00:10.275 --> 00:00:15.570
the beginnings of a rule book about how to use it well.

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.050
It was a project, I started it,

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.010
and I found other people were having the same kind of idea that you can't just

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.345
give people a power tool like that without telling them how to do it, use it.

00:00:27.344 --> 00:00:30.929
So I joined up with some friends of mine that works at

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.920
Microsoft and some at Facebook now,

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.030
and some Googlers have contributed,

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.234
some people from CERN has contributed.

00:00:40.234 --> 00:00:41.630
If you go to GitHub,

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:46.865
you can find that there are lots and lots of contributors,

00:00:46.865 --> 00:00:50.079
and even more gives us ideas when we talk.

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:55.250
Basically, it's an attempt to say what's good programming.

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:00.409
How can we can what a good programmer knows about modern C++.

00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:07.349
So the way it's organized is first, there's introduction,

00:01:07.349 --> 00:01:13.280
about 25 pages or so of basically philosophy because you

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.590
can't give specific rules that are

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.700
coherent without some notion of what's the overall aims,

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.500
what's the overall design,

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.420
what are the rules of the game in general.

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:30.155
So if people want to start to use the core guidelines,

00:01:30.155 --> 00:01:36.079
read the first pages about philosophy and such and take from what it is.

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:37.549
It's philosophy.

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:40.364
But then comes the real rules,

00:01:40.364 --> 00:01:43.714
which says this is a way you can use a for loop.

00:01:43.715 --> 00:01:46.579
This is a way you can organize your error handling.

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:50.390
This is what you have to be careful when you write concurrent code and

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.460
there are several hundred rules of that sort,

00:01:54.459 --> 00:02:00.229
and pick some, and read them and see if they make sense to you.

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:05.180
See if they're applicable to your code base and the way you do things.

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.540
This is what we do now.

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:10.834
But that's not the way it's designed.

00:02:10.835 --> 00:02:17.734
What we've really, really want is a static analyzer that runs over your code,

00:02:17.734 --> 00:02:24.855
and then tells you, this piece of code breaks rule number C33.

00:02:24.854 --> 00:02:30.849
This thing here look at rule F13.

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.434
With a bit of luck, you can click on that message,

00:02:35.433 --> 00:02:39.215
and it will drop you into the core guidelines,

00:02:39.215 --> 00:02:43.414
and all the core guidelines are organized like this here.

00:02:43.414 --> 00:02:48.129
First, there is the number and what it's called,

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:50.379
which is a descriptive title,

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:52.079
then there's a rationale,

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.525
usually one to three lines short,

00:02:54.525 --> 00:02:58.235
then an example, and then anything else you want to know.

00:02:58.235 --> 00:02:59.830
So for the more interesting rules,

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:01.610
there'll be several examples,

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:04.610
and there will be notes and reminders and things like that.

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:10.595
But the way we want to get to is that you don't actually go and read the rules,

00:03:10.594 --> 00:03:13.189
you fire them up on your tool,

00:03:13.189 --> 00:03:16.020
and it'll tell you what to read.

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:25.860
A beginning of that can be found now in Microsoft Visual Studio.

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.000
Microsoft guys wasn't works on that.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.625
That's probably the best one just now.

00:03:31.625 --> 00:03:34.550
It ships with every Visual Studio.

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:37.025
You may have to install it, but it's there,

00:03:37.025 --> 00:03:46.230
and there's a bit coming in the Klang-Tidy has some of the rules too.

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:49.239
So we're working on it.
