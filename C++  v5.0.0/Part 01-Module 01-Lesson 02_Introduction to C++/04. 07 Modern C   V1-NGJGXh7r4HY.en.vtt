00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.984
When people talk about Modern C++,

00:00:02.984 --> 00:00:06.314
they're often referring to the C++ 11 release,

00:00:06.315 --> 00:00:10.785
which introduced a whole range of new features into the programming language.

00:00:10.785 --> 00:00:13.859
Move semantics, variadic templates,

00:00:13.859 --> 00:00:16.769
initializer lists, the auto keyword,

00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:19.320
lambda expressions, null pointer,

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.160
constant expression, range-based four loops, and smart pointers,

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.160
all came into the C++ programming language as part

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.210
of C++ 11 and changed the language dramatically.

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.250
C++ 14 was a relatively minor release,

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:36.979
and C++ 17 was a major release,

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:40.125
although not as big as the C++ 11 release.

00:00:40.125 --> 00:00:45.619
C++ 17 includes standard file system within the standard library,

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:49.189
standard string view, parallel implementations of

00:00:49.189 --> 00:00:53.359
many of the standard library algorithms, and inline variables.

00:00:53.359 --> 00:00:59.075
C++ 20 is scheduled as a minor release but will contain concepts

00:00:59.075 --> 00:01:05.730
which are an important tool for improving generic programming with templates in C++.
