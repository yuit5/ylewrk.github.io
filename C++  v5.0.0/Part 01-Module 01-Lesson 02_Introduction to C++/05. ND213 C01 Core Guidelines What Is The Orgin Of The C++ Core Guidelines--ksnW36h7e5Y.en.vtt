One of the things I'm working on now as an open-source project

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.245
together with people from a variety of companies all over the world,

00:00:16.245 --> 00:00:18.420
is something called the core guidelines,

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.220
which is a set of rules,

00:00:20.219 --> 00:00:22.019
that among other things says,

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:26.189
"These are the places where you're not strongly typed,

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:28.140
where you can get yourself into trouble."

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.875
We're going to leak some buffer overflows and all the other good stuff.

00:00:31.875 --> 00:00:33.600
However, we know where they are,

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.740
and we provide you with tools that can guarantee you don't do it.
