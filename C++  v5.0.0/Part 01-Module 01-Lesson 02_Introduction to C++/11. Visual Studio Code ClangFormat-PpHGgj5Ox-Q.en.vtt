00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.669
I'm in Visual Studio Code and I would like to apply clang-format to my hello.cpp file.

00:00:08.669 --> 00:00:13.695
So I'm going to go to the extensions and I'm going to search for clang-format,

00:00:13.695 --> 00:00:16.425
and I'm going to install it.

00:00:16.425 --> 00:00:18.199
Now, it's installed and it says,

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:21.179
"Files can be formatted on-demand by right-clicking in

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:24.509
the document and selecting format document,

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.280
or by using the associated keyboard shortcut usually Ctrl Shift F on Windows,

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:30.600
Ctrl Shift I on Linux,

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.530
and Shift Command F on Mac OS.

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.545
So I'm on Linux, so I want Ctrl Shift I.

00:00:37.545 --> 00:00:43.304
Now, if I come here to hello.cpp and I hit Ctrl Shift I,

00:00:43.304 --> 00:00:48.465
clang-format actually puts my one line, "Hello World!"

00:00:48.465 --> 00:00:52.055
implementation on the same line as my function signature.

00:00:52.054 --> 00:00:57.590
If I save this and I compile it and run it,

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:04.840
everything should still work but I have clang-format's default formatting style.
