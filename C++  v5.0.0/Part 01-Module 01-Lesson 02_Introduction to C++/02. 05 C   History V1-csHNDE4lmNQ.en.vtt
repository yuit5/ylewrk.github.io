00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.195
Bjarne Stroustrup created C++ in 1979 when he was only 29 years old.

00:00:06.195 --> 00:00:09.660
He was working at Bell Labs and needed a programming language

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.425
to help him maintain clusters of Unix servers.

00:00:13.425 --> 00:00:15.810
He wanted a programming language with

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:20.190
both the high level features of languages like Simula and

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:26.885
the raw speed of C. So he created a language that he called C with classes.

00:00:26.885 --> 00:00:31.325
C with classes had features like classes and

00:00:31.324 --> 00:00:38.250
also strong types but maintain the lightning fast speed of the C programming language.

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.790
C++ as he later renamed it took off and eventually was adopted by

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:47.000
the International Standards Organization which created

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.170
an ISO standard governing the C++ programming language.

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:56.210
That means that C++ is not controlled by any one person but rather by

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.895
a standards body that meets regularly

00:00:58.895 --> 00:01:02.450
to map out the future of the C++ programming language.

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:07.290
In 2011, the C++ Standards Committee

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:13.930
released C++11 which was a major update to the programming language standard.

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:16.370
C++11 turned C++ into

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:21.680
a truly modern programming language that has both the elegance and ease of

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.610
development that we associate with modern programming languages while

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:30.094
maintaining the raw performance that C++ has always had.

00:01:30.094 --> 00:01:32.599
Bjarne Stroustrup remains involved in

00:01:32.599 --> 00:01:37.849
the C++ programming language to this day as a member of the ISO standards committee,

00:01:37.849 --> 00:01:40.609
and he'll be teaching you throughout this program about

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:44.730
the different facilities of the C++ programming language
